Engagement of Services. Company engages Advisor to provide the services set forth on Schedule A attached hereto. Schedule A can be amended from time to time should the scope of services change at any time.2. Compensation; Timing. Company will pay Advisor the fee set forth on Schedule A. Company will reimburse Advisor’s expenses which have been approved beforehand in writing by Company (email acceptable) no later than thirty (30) days after Company’s receipt of Advisor’s invoice, provided that reimbursement for expenses may be delayed until such time as Advisor has furnished reasonable documentation for authorized expenses as Company may reasonably request. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Advisor will be (a) paid fees on the basis stated on Schedule A and (b) reimbursed only for expenses that are incurred pursuant to this Section 2 prior to termination of this Agreement.3. Independent Contractor Relationship(a) Advisor’s relationship with Company is that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or shall be construed to, create a partnership, agency, joint venture, employment or similar relationship. Advisor will not be entitled to any of the benefits that Company may make available to its employees, including, but not limited to, group health or life insurance, profit-sharing or retirement benefits, vacation days, sick days, or holidays. Advisor is not authorized to make any representation, contract or commitment on behalf of Company unless specifically requested or authorized in writing to do so by a Company manager. Advisor is solely responsible for, and will file, on a timely basis, all tax returns and payments required to be filed with, or made to, any federal, state or local tax authority with respect to the performance of services and receipt of fees under this Agreement. Advisor is solely responsible for, and must maintain adequate records of, expenses incurred in the course of performing services under this Agreement. No part of Advisor’s compensation will be subject to withholding by Company for the payment of any social security, federal, state or any other employee payroll taxes. Advisor is solely responsible for and assumes full responsibility for (as applicable) the payment of FICA, FUTA and income taxes and compliance with any other international, federal, state, or local laws, rules and regulations. Company will regularly report amounts paid to Advisor by filing Form 1099-MISC with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law.(b) Company understands and agrees that Advisor shall render services in whatever manner deemed appropriate by Advisor. During the term of this Agreement, Advisor agrees to perform the services on a professional best-efforts basis, in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and in accordance with the highest applicable industry standards.(c) Company shall not control or direct, nor shall the Company have any right to control or direct, the result of or the details, methods, manner or means by which Advisor performs his or her business or services, except that Advisor shall coordinate services with the Company, shall provide services in accordance with generally accepted industry standards and in compliance with all international, federal, state, and local laws.(d) Advisor has and will at all times retain the exclusive right to control and direct the method, details, and means of performing the services under this Agreement. Company shall not specify the amount of time required to perform individual aspects of the services. Advisor’s services are not exclusive to the Company, and Advisor may render services for other business entities.4. Reserved15. Confidentiality(a) Definition of Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means (a) any technical and non-technical information related to Company’s business and current, future and proposed products and services of Company, including for example and without limitation, Company Property (as defined in Section 5(d)), and Company’s information concerning research, development, design details and specifications, financial information, procurement requirements, engineering and manufacturing information, customer lists, business forecasts, sales information and marketing plans and (b) any information that may be made known to Advisor and that Company has received from others that Company is obligated to treat as confidential or proprietary.(b) Non-Disclosure and Nonuse Obligations. During Advisor's independent contractor relationship under this Agreement, Company shall provide to Advisor Confidential Information. In exchange for the Company's promise to provide Advisor with Confidential Information, and except as permitted in this Section 5(b), Advisor shall not use, disseminate or in any way disclose the Confidential Information. Advisor may use the Confidential Information solely to perform services pursuant to this Agreement for the benefit of Company. Advisor shall treat all Confidential Information with the same degree of care as Advisor accords to Advisor’s own confidential information, but in no case shall Advisor use less than reasonable care. If Advisor is not an individual, Advisor shall disclose Confidential Information only to those of Advisor’s employees who have a need to know such information. Advisor certifies that each such employee will have agreed, either as a condition of employment or in order to obtain the Confidential Information, to be bound by terms and conditions at least as protective as those terms and conditions applicable to Advisor under this Agreement. Advisor shall immediately give notice to Company of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. Advisor shall assist Company in remedying any such unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. Advisor agrees not to communicate any information to Company in violation of the proprietary rights of any third party.(c) Exclusions from Non-Disclosure and Nonuse Obligations. Advisor’s obligations under Section (b) shall not apply to any Confidential Information that Advisor can demonstrate (a) was in the public domain at or subsequent to the time such Confidential Information was communicated to Advisor by Company through no fault of Advisor; (b) was rightfully in Advisor’s possession free of any obligation of confidence at or subsequent to the time such Confidential Information was communicated to Advisor by Company; or (c) was developed by employees of Advisor independently of and without reference to any Confidential Information communicated to Advisor by Company. A disclosure of any Confidential Information by Advisor (a) in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body or (b) as otherwise required by law shall not be considered to be a breach of this Agreement or a waiver of confidentiality for other purposes; provided, however, that Advisor shall provide prompt prior written notice thereof to Company to enable Company to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent such disclosure.(d) Ownership and Return of Confidential Information and Company Property. All Confidential Information and any materials (including, without limitation, documents, drawings, papers, diskettes, tapes, models, apparatus, sketches, designs and lists) furnished to Advisor by Company, whether delivered to Advisor by Company or made by Advisor in the performance of services under this Agreement and whether or not they contain or disclose Confidential Information (collectively, the “Company Property”), are the sole and exclusive property of Company or Company’s suppliers or customers. Advisor agrees to keep all Company Property at Advisor’s premises unless otherwise permitted in writing by Company. Within five (5) days after any request by Company, Advisor shall destroy or deliver to Company, at Company’s option, (a) all Company Property and (b) all materials in Advisor’s possession or control that contain or disclose any Confidential Information. Advisor will provide Company a written certification of Advisor’s compliance with Advisor’s obligations under this Section 5(d).6. Indemnification. Advisor will indemnify and hold harmless Company from and against any and all third party claims, suits, actions, demands and proceedings against Company and all losses, costs and liabilities related thereto arising out of or related to (i) an allegation that any item, material and other deliverable delivered by Advisor under this Agreement infringes any intellectual property rights or publicity rights of a third party or (ii) any negligence by Advisor or any other act or omission of Advisor, including without limitation any breach of this Agreement by Advisor.7. Observance of Company Rules. At all times while on Company’s premises, Advisor will observe Company’s rules and regulations with respect to conduct, health, safety and protection of persons and property.8. No Conflict of Interest. During the term of this Agreement, Advisor will not accept work, enter into a contract or accept an obligation inconsistent or incompatible with Advisor’s obligations, or the scope of services to be rendered for Company, under this Agreement. Advisor warrants that, to the best of Advisor’s knowledge, there is no other existing contract or duty on Advisor’s part that conflicts with or is inconsistent with this Agreement. Advisor agrees to indemnify Company from any and all loss or liability incurred by reason of the alleged breach by Advisor of any services agreement with any third party.29. Reserved.10. Term and Termination(a) Term. This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date set forth above and shall continue indefinitely unless and until terminated by either party as set forth below.(b) Termination by Company. Company may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time, with termination effective fifteen (15) days after Company’s delivery to Advisor of written notice of termination (email acceptable). Company also may terminate this Agreement immediately for a material breach by Advisor if Advisor’s material breach of any provision of this Agreement is not cured within ten (10) days after the date of Company’s written notice of breach (email acceptable).(c) Termination by Advisor. Advisor may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time, with termination effective fifteen (15) days after Advisor’s delivery to Company of written notice of termination (email acceptable). Advisor also may terminate this Agreement immediately for a material breach by Company if Company’s material breach of any provision of this Agreement is not cured within ten (10) days after the date of Advisor’s written notice of breach (email acceptable).(d) Effect of Expiration or Termination. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, Company shall pay Advisor for services performed under this Agreement as set forth on Schedule A. The definitions contained in this Agreement and the rights and obligations contained in this Section 10(d) and Sections 5 and 11 will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.11. General Provisions(a) Successors and Assigns. Advisor may not subcontract or otherwise delegate Advisor’s obligations under this Agreement without Company’s prior written consent. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be for the benefit of Company’s successors and assigns, and will be binding on Advisor’s assignees.(b) Injunctive Relief. Advisor’s obligations under this Agreement are of a unique character that gives them particular value; Advisor’s breach of any of such obligations will result in irreparable and continuing damage to Company for which money damages are insufficient, and Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief and/or a decree for specific performance, and such other relief as may be proper (including money damages if appropriate).(c) Notices. Any and all notices, requests, demands, or other communications provided for hereunder, shall be given in writing by personal service, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, overnight delivery service, delivery charges prepaid, or by email, facsimile or other electronic means addressed to the intended recipients. A notice shall be deemed to have been received when personally served or delivered or five (5) days after being mailed, or one (1) day after being sent by overnight delivery service or by email, facsimile or other electronic means.3(d) Governing Law; Forum. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the United States of America and by the laws of the State of Texas, as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Texas between Texas residents. Each of the parties irrevocably consents to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Texas, as applicable, for any matter arising out of or relating to this Agreement, except that in actions seeking to enforce any order or any judgment of such federal or state courts located in Texas, such personal jurisdiction shall be nonexclusive. Additionally, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, a claim for equitable relief arising out of or related to this Agreement may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.(e) Severability. If a court of law holds any provision of this Agreement to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) that provision shall be deemed amended to achieve an economic effect that is as near as possible to that provided by the original provision and (b) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.(f) Waiver; Modification. If Company waives any term, provision or Advisor’s breach of this Agreement, such waiver shall not be effective unless it is in writing and signed by Company. No waiver by a party of a breach of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach by Advisor. This Agreement may be modified only by mutual written agreement of authorized representatives of the parties.(g) Entire Agreement.

If it is determined that there has been an undercharge, Rhodia shall immediately pay the undercharge to Partnership plus any additional amounts not previously paid hereunder. 3.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3, with respect to any Contract Year after the (****) Contract Year hereunder, if Rhodia notifies Partnership of a bona fide opportunity, and provides a copy thereof in writing (showing all terms of the offer, including the offering party), under which Rhodia is to purchase a quantity of phosphoric acid of a quality equal to or better than a specific Product manufactured by Partnership at a price F.O.B. rail car customs cleared U.S. East Coast port that, giving effect to all conditions of such offer, is at least ten percent (10%) less than the price per short ton then in effect under this Agreement for the relevant Product (the “Lower Offer”), Partnership shall have the option to meet the Lower Offer within fifteen (15) calendar days after notification by Rhodia, for the same annual quantity as that to which the Lower Offer relates. In the event that Partnership does not elect to meet the Lower Offer, then (i) Rhodia shall be released from its obligation hereunder to purchase the annual volume of the Lower Offer up to an amount equal to the lesser of (a) (****) short tons of the Product or (b) (****) short tons of the Product minus the sum of all then effective Released Quantities and Met Quantities (both as hereinafter defined), and (ii) the portion of each type of Product required to be purchased by Rhodia as set forth in Exhibit C shall be proportionately reduced to equal the result of multiplying the annual amount of such Product which Rhodia is required to purchase as set forth in Exhibit C times a fraction, the numerator of which is the total annual number of short tons of all Product required to be purchased as set forth in Exhibit C minus the Released Quantity and the denominator of which is (****). “Released Quantity” means the annual quantity of short tons of Product that Rhodia has been released from its obligation to purchase hereunder pursuant to a Lower Offer presented to Partnership by Rhodia in accordance with this Section, “Met Quantity” means the annual quantity of short tons of Product for which Partnership has reduced the purchase price hereunder pursuant to a Lower Offer presented to Partnership by Rhodia in accordance with this Section. With respect to all Released Quantities hereunder, such right to purchase from such third party must be exercised in writing by Rhodia within sixty (60) calendar days and shall be effective twelve (12) months after Partnership’s receipt of Rhodia’s notice of the Lower Offer in accordance with the notice provisions set forth herein. In the event that Rhodia shall accept any Lower Offer from such third party pursuant to the terms hereof, then, upon the expiration of the contract or other arrangement entered into pursuant to such Lower Offer, Rhodia shall revert to 4the purchase of quantities of Product from Partnership, at the then effective price hereunder, which Rhodia was required to purchase prior to application of this Section. In the event that Partnership elects to meet the Lower Offer, then (i) Partnership shall sell to Rhodia on an annual basis the quantity of Product as to that which the Lower Offer relates, up to an annual amount equal to the lesser of (a) (****) short tons of the Product or (b) (****) short tons of the Product minus the sum of all then effective Released Quantities and Met Quantities at the price per short ton in the applicable Lower Offer (the “Met Price”) for the term specified in the Lower Offer (the “Met Term”), and (ii) the Met Price shall remain in effect with respect to the Met Quantity for the entirety of the Met Term despite any subsequent Lower Offer received by Rhodia that contains a price per short ton less than the Met Price. Upon the expiration of the applicable Met Term, Rhodia shall revert to the purchase of Product from Partnership at such price that Rhodia was required to pay prior to adjustment under this Section. Rhodia shall be entitled to present subsequent Lower Offers to Partnership under this Section so long as, at the time of any such subsequent Lower Offer, the sum of all effective Released Quantities and Met Quantities does not exceed (****) short tons of Product on an annual basis. 4. Quantity. 4.1 For each Contract Year, Partnership shall sell and ship to Rhodia, and Rhodia shall purchase from Partnership, Low Alkali Product, Low Sulfate Product and High Alkali Product ordered by Rhodia subject to the parameters set forth in Exhibit C (except as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing). In the event that Rhodia does not purchase the applicable required minimum volume of High Alkali Product during any Contract Year and Partnership recycles High Alkali Product, Rhodia shall pay a “Recycle Fee” for all such tons of High Alkali Product so recycled equal to the difference between the applicable minimum volume on High Alkali Product and the actual amount of High Alkali Product purchased by Rhodia during such Contract Year. The Recycle Fee for Contract Year 2000 is $(****) per short ton of P2O5. The Recycle Fee for Contract Years after 2000 shall be the product of (i) $(****) and (ii) a fraction in which (a) the price per short ton P2O5 of High Alkali Product for the applicable Contract Year, calculated in accordance with this Agreement, is the numerator and (b) $(****) per short ton P2O5 is the denominator. 4.2 If, at any time during the term of this Agreement, Rhodia reasonably determines that it is not in Rhodia’s economic interest to continue to purchase the Low Alkali Product, Low Sulfate Product or High Alkali Product, due to events or circumstances outside of Rhodia’s control (including, but not limited to, customer demand, market pricing conditions and government regulations (other than government regulations that would excuse Rhodia’s delay in performance or non-performance of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8 hereof)), which eliminate Rhodia’s earnings (before interest and taxes as determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles) on any Products purchased from Partnership or any products incorporating such Products for a consecutive eighteen-month (18-month) period (such determinations constituting a declaration by Rhodia of “economic force majeure”); then Rhodia shall notify Partnership in writing of such determinations and, beginning on the date of Rhodia’s notice (the “EFM Notice Date”) and ending no later than six (6) months from the EFM Notice Date, the parties will discuss and 5evaluate in good faith, proposals to address such economic force majeure in a manner that (i) does not obligate Partnership to suffer any adverse financial or operational consequences therefrom and (ii) provides Rhodia with some relief from the financial consequences thereof. Upon expiration of such period, Partnership, in the exercise of its sole discretion and upon written notice to Rhodia, will select a proposal to address such economic force majeure should it continue, which approach shall be implemented on or before eighteen (18) months from the EFM Notice Date, provided that Rhodia has the right to reject any approach selected by Partnership and to continue to operate under the terms of this Agreement. 5. Order Procedure; Delivery. 5.1 On or before the September 15th prior to the commencement of each Contract Year, Rhodia shall give Partnership written notice of its estimate of the quantity of each Product to be supplied by Partnership hereunder during such Contract Year. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4 above, nothing herein shall require Rhodia to purchase quantities of Product equal to the annual estimate. Seven (7) business days prior to the first day of each month, Rhodia shall provide Partnership with a three-month projection of its quantity requirements hereunder. The quantities specified for the first month of such three-month projection shall be binding upon Rhodia; however, the amounts specified for the remaining two (2) months shall be estimates only and shall not bind Rhodia. 5.2 Rhodia shall issue purchase instructions from time to time for its requirements of Products not less than two (2) days prior to its intended shipment date. Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill each order on the shipment date set forth therein. Shipments for each Contract Quarter shall be scheduled in reasonably equivalent monthly volumes, with variations for any month not exceeding plus or minus 20% of one-twelfth (1/12th) of the proposed annual volumes to be purchased hereunder (i.e. the annual volume of each Product noticed pursuant to Section 5.1 above) unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties. 5.3 Partnership shall, at Rhodia’s sole cost, arrange delivery of Products purchased hereunder from the Aurora Plant to the relevant delivery point specified by Rhodia. Delivery shall be via rail cars or tank trucks made available by Rhodia. Rhodia shall reimburse Partnership each month for all costs incurred by Partnership under this Section 5.3, including all actual duties and the costs of insurance and of providing, maintaining and loading such tank cars or tank trucks, as the case may be, after the Products leave the Aurora Plant. 6. Title and Risk of Loss. Title, and risk of loss or damage, to Products shall pass to Rhodia at such time as Products are pumped into rail tank cars or tank trucks, as the case may be, at the Aurora Plant. 7. Limited Warranty; Indemnification. 7.1 Partnership warrants title and that the Products shall conform to the specifications set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto. Subject to the preceding sentence and 6except as otherwise expressly provided herein, PARTNERSHIP MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, AS TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY OTHER MATTER WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS, WHETHER USED ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH ANY OTHER MATERIAL. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM A DELAY OR FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE OR ANY OTHER DEFAULT HEREUNDER EXCEPT FOR ANY DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE LIABLE PARTY. 7.2 Rhodia may reject Products not conforming to the corresponding specifications set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto by delivering notice to Partnership within 75 calendar days of the delivery of such Products to Rhodia. Failure to give notice within 75 calendar days after receipt by Rhodia of Products shall constitute acceptance of such Products. Partnership shall have the right to inspect the Products so rejected for the purpose of confirming their nonconformance to the corresponding specifications set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto. If Rhodia and Partnership agree that such Products conform to the corresponding specifications set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto, Rhodia shall revoke its rejection of, and shall accept, such Products. If Rhodia and Partnership are unable to agree as to whether such Products are nonconforming or not, they shall select an independent laboratory to analyze the Products, whose determination shall be conclusive. All analyses conducted pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in accordance with the analysis procedures listed on Exhibit B attached hereto. 7.3 If (i) Products delivered to Rhodia fail to meet the corresponding specifications set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto, (ii) Rhodia notifies Partnership of such nonconformance within 60 calendar days of delivery and (iii) Rhodia nevertheless accepts such Products, then Rhodia and Partnership shall negotiate in good faith to adjust the price to be paid by Rhodia for such Products. 8. Force Majeure. Partnership and Rhodia shall each be excused for any delay in performance or for non-performance of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, other than payment of money, caused by any cause or circumstance beyond their respective control including, but not limited to, any act of God, fire, flood, or governmental regulations, governmental directive (including, without limitation, any governmental regulation, directive that prevents Rhodia’s customers from consuming Products or materials manufactured by Rhodia using the Products or selling products made therefrom), accident, strikes, lockouts or unavoidable breakdowns, for the duration and to the extent that any such cause or circumstance affects the production, delivery, acceptance, transportation or consumption of Products hereunder. Each party hereto agrees to give the other party notice, as early as reasonably possible, of any cause or circumstance which might give rise to a delay, interruption or reduction on any delivery or acceptance of Products hereunder, so that the other party might make appropriate other arrangements. In the event Partnership is unable to supply the full quantities of Products required hereunder due to such cause or circumstance, Partnership shall, in allocating 7available supplies of Products, accord Rhodia parity with respect to the requirements of Partnership, Partnership’s affiliated companies, and Partnership’s other customers. In the event that Partnership is excused from performance hereunder in accordance with this Section 8, for so long as such nonperformance continues, Rhodia shall be allowed to purchase phosphoric acid from third-party manufacturers in an amount equal to the volume unfulfilled by Partnership. After cessation of the effects of a cause or circumstance as described above, Partnership shall not be required to make up, nor shall Rhodia be required to accept, any deliveries or quantities of Products the supply of which had been excused as a result of such cause or circumstance pursuant to the provisions of this Section. 9. Taxes. The price specified herein does not include any sales, excise, customs or similar tax, charge, duty or cost levied or imposed as of this date by any federal, state, municipal or other governmental authority upon the manufacture, sale, delivery, shipment or use of Products sold hereunder, and any such tax, charge or cost, as well as any increases therein or any similar taxes or charges levied after the date of this Agreement shall be for the account of Rhodia.

In any event, any amounts received or invoiced by Vyera or its Affiliates shall be accounted for only once. For purposes of determining Net Sales, a Licensed Product shall be deemed to be sold when recorded as a sale by Vyera or its Affiliates in accordance with GAAP. For clarity, a particular deduction may only be accounted for once in the calculation of Net Sales. Net Sales shall exclude any samples of Licensed Product transferred or disposed of at no expense for promotional or educational purposes.In the event that a Licensed Product is sold as a Combination Product, Net Sales shall be determined as follows:(A) where all API(s) in such Combination Product are sold separately in the Territory, Net Sales shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Sales of the Combination Product by the fraction A/(A+B), where A is the weighted (by sales volume) average unit sale price of the Licensed Product, as sold separately in finished form in the Territory, where net sales is calculated in the same manner as Net Sales, and B is the sum of the weighted average unit sale price in the Territory (net sales being calculated in the same manner as Net Sales) of the other API(s) included in the Combination Product when sold separately in finished form at the same dosage levels, in each case during the applicable royalty reporting period, or, if sales of both the Licensed Product and the other API(s) did not occur in the same country in such period, then in the most recent royalty reporting period in which sales of both occurred, provided that such “recent royalty reporting period” shall not have been more than twenty-four (24) months earlier.(B) In the event that such weighted average sale price of the Licensed Product component of the Combination Product cannot be determined, but the weighted average sale price of the other API(s) in the Combination Product can be determined, Net Sales shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Sales of the Combination Product by the fraction (C-D)/C, where C is the weighted (by sales volume) average unit sale price of the Combination Product, and D is the sum of the weighted (by sales volume) average unit sales prices charged for the other API(s) in the Combination Product when sold separately in finished form.(C) In the event that such weighted average sale price of the other API(s) in the Combination Product cannot be determined, but the weighted average sale price of the Licensed Product component of the Combination Product can be determined, Net Sales shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Sales of the Combination Product by the fraction A/C, where A is the weighted (by sales volume) average unit sales price of such Licensed Product component as sold separately, and C is the weighted (by sales volume) average unit sales price of the Combination Product.(D) In the event that neither the weighted average sale price of the Licensed Product nor the weighted average sales price of the other API(s) in the Combination Product can be determined, the Net Sales of the Licensed Product shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Sales of the Combination Product (determined as provided above for Licensed Products) by the fraction D/D+E where D is the fair market value of the portion of the Combination Product that includes the Licensed Product and E is the fair market value of the portion of the Combination Product containing the other API(s) in such Combination Product, and all such fair market values shall be determined in good faith by the Parties.In the event either Party reasonably believes that the calculation set forth above does not fairly reflect the value of the Licensed Product, relative to the other API(s) in the Combination Product, the Parties shall negotiate, in good faith, other means of calculating Net Sales with respect to Combination Products to so reflect such value.The weighted average sale price for a Licensed Product, any other API(s) used in a Combination Product, or any Combination Product shall be calculated once each Calendar Year, at the beginning of such Calendar Year, and such price shall be used during all applicable royalty reporting periods for such entire Calendar Year. When determining the weighted average sale price of a Licensed Product, other API(s), or Combination Product, the weighted average sale price shall be calculated by dividing the sales dollar (translated into U.S. dollars) by the units of active ingredient sold during the preceding Calendar Year (or the number of months sold in a partial Calendar Year) for the respective Licensed Product, other API(s), or Combination Product. In the initial Calendar Year, a forecasted weighted average sale price will be used for the Licensed Product, other API(s) or Combination Product.1.78 “Non-Breaching Party” has the meaning set forth in Section 11.4.1.79 “Party(ies)” has the meaning set forth in the introductory paragraph.1.80 “Patents” means all: (a) patents, including any utility or design patent; (b) patent applications, including provisionals, substitutions, divisionals, continuations, continuations in-part or renewals; (c) patents of addition, restorations, extensions, supplementary protection certificates, registration or confirmation patents, patents resulting from post-grant proceedings, re-issues and re-examinations; (d) other patents or patent applications claiming priority directly or indirectly to: (i) any such specified patent or patent application specified in (a) through (c), or (ii) any patent or patent application from which a patent or patent application specified in (a) through (c) claim direct or indirect priority; (e) inventor’s certificates; (f) other rights issued from a Governmental Authority similar to any of the foregoing; and (g) in each of (a) through (f), whether such patent, patent application or other right arises in the Territory.1.81 “Payments” has the meaning set forth in Section 8.10.1.82 “Person” means an individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, corporation, limited liability company, business trust, joint stock company, trust, incorporated association, joint venture or similar entity or organization, including a government or political subdivision, department or agency of a government.1.83 “Pharmacovigilance Agreement” means the safety data exchange agreement that the Parties will use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to agree and enter into within ninety (90) days after the Effective Date.1.84 “Promotional Materials” means all training materials and all written, printed, graphic, electronic, audio or video matter, including journal advertisements, sales visual aids, leave items, formulary binders, reprints, direct mail, direct-to-consumer advertising, Internet postings and broadcast advertisements, in each case, created by Vyera or its Affiliates or on its behalf, and used or intended for use in connection with any promotion of the Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory under this Agreement.1.85 “Quality Agreement” has the meaning set forth in Section 6.3.1.86 “Receiving Party” has the meaning set forth in Section 10.1.1.87 “Regulatory Approval” means any and all approvals (including supplements, amendments, pre- and post-approvals), licenses, registrations or authorizations of any national, regional, state or local Regulatory Authority, department, bureau, commission, council or other governmental entity, that are necessary for the commercialization of a Licensed Product under this Agreement in the Field in the Territory.1.88 “Regulatory Authority” means: (a) any applicable Governmental Authority involved in granting Regulatory Approval in a country or jurisdiction in the Territory, including the FDA; and (b) any other applicable Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over a pharmaceutical Licensed Product.1.89 “Regulatory Documentation” means, with respect to each Licensed Product, all: (a) Regulatory Materials, including all data contained therein and all supporting documents created for, submitted to or received from an applicable governmental agency or Regulatory Authority relating to such Regulatory Materials; and (b) other documentation Controlled by a Party which is reasonably necessary in order to Commercialize Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory, including any registrations and licenses, regulatory drug lists, advertising and promotion documents shared with Regulatory Authorities, adverse event files, complaint files and Manufacturing records.1.90 “Regulatory Exclusivity” means, with respect to any Licensed Product in the Territory, any additional market protection, other than patent protection, granted by a Regulatory Authority in the Territory which confers an exclusive Commercialization period during which Vyera or its Affiliates have the exclusive right to market and sell such Licensed Product in the Field and in the Territory through a regulatory exclusivity right (e.g., new biologic entity exclusivity, new use or indication exclusivity, new formulation exclusivity, orphan drug exclusivity, pediatric exclusivity, or any applicable data exclusivity).1.91 “Regulatory Materials” means, with respect to the Licensed Product, all documentation, correspondence, submissions and notifications submitted to or received from a Regulatory Authority that are necessary or reasonably useful in order to Commercialize such Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory.

The amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement (“Payments”) shall not be reduced on account of any taxes unless required by Applicable Law. Vyera shall deduct and withhold from the Payments any taxes that it is required by Applicable Law to deduct or withhold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if CytoDyn is entitled under any applicable tax treaty to a reduction of rate of, or the elimination of, or recovery of, applicable withholding tax, it may deliver to Vyera or the appropriate Governmental Authority the prescribed forms necessary to reduce the applicable rate of withholding or to relieve Vyera of its obligation to withhold tax. In such case Vyera shall apply the reduced rate of withholding, or not withhold, as the case may be, provided that Vyera is in receipt of evidence, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Vyera, for example CytoDyn’s delivery of all required documentation at least five (5) Business Days prior to the time that the Payments are due. If, in accordance with the foregoing, Vyera withholds any amount, it shall pay to CytoDyn the balance when due, make timely payment to the proper taxing authority of the withheld amount, and send CytoDyn proof of such payment within thirty (30) days following that payment.8.11 Audit.

The audit rights set forth in this Section 8.11 shall survive the Term for a period of three (3) years.8.12 Late Payment. All payments due to a Party under this Agreement shall be made in U.S. Dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account designated by the receiving Party.

The Parties further agree that the decision of the arbitrators shall be the sole, exclusive and binding remedy between them regarding determination of arbitration matters presented.(f)The Parties hereby agree that any disputed performance or suspended performance pending the resolution of an arbitration matter that the arbitrators determine to be required to be performed by a Party must be completed within a reasonable time period following the final decision of the arbitrators.(g)Each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees, costs, and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the arbitrators; provided, however, that the arbitrators shall be authorized to determine whether a Party is the prevailing Party, and if so, to award to that prevailing Party reimbursement for its reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and disbursements (including, for example, expert witness fees and expenses, photocopy charges and travel expenses), and/or the fees and costs of the arbitrators.(h)Except to the extent necessary to confirm an award or decision or as may be required by Applicable Laws, neither a Party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of an arbitration without the prior written consent of both Parties.(i)By agreeing to this binding arbitration provision, the Parties understand that they are waiving certain rights and protections which may otherwise be available if a dispute between the Parties were determined by litigation in court, including the right to seek or obtain certain types of damages precluded by this provision, the right to a jury trial, certain rights of appeal, and a right to invoke formal rules of procedure and evidence.12.4 Reserved Disputes. Certain disputes that are specifically defined below shall be finally decided by the executive officer of one of the Parties (“Reserved Disputes”). In such cases, the executive officer of that Party shall make his or her decision with regard to the Reserved Dispute within twenty (20) days of its referral and such decision shall be final and binding and shall not be subject to Section 12.3. Reserved Disputes shall not include disputes with respect to the interpretation, breach, termination or invalidity of this Agreement. [***]12.5 Preliminary Injunctions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, a Party may seek a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction in order to prevent immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage on a provisional basis.12.6 Patent and Trademark Disputes. Notwithstanding anything in this Article 12 or Section 14.2 of this Agreement to the contrary, as between the Parties, and pursuant to Section 9.3(c) (with respect to matters subject to Section 9.3(c)), any and all issues regarding the scope, construction, validity, and enforceability of any Patent or trademark relating to a Licensed Product that is the subject of this Agreement shall be determined in a court or other tribunal, as the case may be, of competent jurisdiction under applicable Federal patent or trademark laws.12.7 Tolling. During the pendency of any Dispute resolution proceeding between the Parties under this Article 12, the obligation to make any payment under this Agreement from one Party to the other Party, which payment is the subject, in whole or in part, of a proceeding under this Article 12, shall be tolled until the final outcome of such Dispute has been established. Any undisputed payment obligations (including undisputed portions of a payment obligation that is subject to a proceeding under this Article 12) shall not be tolled during such Dispute.12.8 Confidentiality. Any and all activities conducted under this Article 12, including any and all proceedings and decisions hereunder, shall be deemed Confidential Information of each of the Parties, and shall be subject to Article 10.12.9 WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL. In connection with the Parties’ rights under this Article 12, EACH PARTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS IT CONTEMPLATES. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO ANY ACTION OR LEGAL PROCEEDING, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE.ARTICLE 13INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE13.1 Indemnification by Vyera. Vyera hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless CytoDyn and its Affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (each, a “CytoDyn Indemnitee”) from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, demands, liabilities, expenses and/or losses, including reasonable legal expenses and attorneys’ fees (collectively, the “Losses”), to which any CytoDyn Indemnitee may become subject as a result of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding by any Third Party (each, a “Claim”) to the extent such Losses arise directly or indirectly out of: (a) the breach by Vyera of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement made by Vyera in this Agreement; (b) Commercialization activities undertaken by or on behalf of Vyera or its Affiliates; (c) the negligence, gross negligence, illegal conduct or willful misconduct of Vyera or its Affiliate, or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative thereof; except, with respect to each of subsections (a), (b) and (c) above, to the extent such Losses arise directly or indirectly from the negligence, gross negligence, illegal conduct or willful misconduct of any CytoDyn Indemnitee or the breach by CytoDyn of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement made by CytoDyn in this Agreement.13.2 Indemnification by CytoDyn. CytoDyn hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Vyera and its Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (each, a “Vyera Indemnitee”) from and against any and all Losses to which any Vyera Indemnitee may become subject as a result of any Claim to the extent such Losses arise directly or indirectly out of: (a) the breach by CytoDyn of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement made by CytoDyn in this Agreement; (b) the negligence, gross negligence, illegal conduct, or willful misconduct of CytoDyn or its Affiliate or its licensee (other than Vyera or its Affiliate), or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative thereof; or (c) subject to Section 8.7, the infringement of Third Party Patents or the misappropriation of Third Party Know-How by the sale, offer for sale or use of any Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory; except, with respect to each of subsections (a), (b) or (c) above, to the extent such Losses arise directly or indirectly from the negligence, gross negligence, illegal conduct or willful misconduct of any Vyera Indemnitee or the breach by Vyera of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement made by Vyera in this Agreement.13.3 Indemnification Procedures.(a)Notice. Promptly after a CytoDyn Indemnitee or a Vyera Indemnitee (each, an “Indemnitee”) receives notice of a pending or threatened Claim, such Indemnitee shall give written notice of the Claim to the Party from whom the Indemnitee is entitled to receive indemnification pursuant to Sections 13.1 or 13.2, as applicable (the “Indemnifying Party”). However, an Indemnitee’s delay in providing or failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except to the extent it can demonstrate actual prejudice due to the delay or lack of notice.(b)Defense. Upon receipt of notice under this Section 13.3 from the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party will have the duty to either compromise or defend, at its own expense and by counsel (reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee) such Claim. The Indemnifying Party will promptly (and in any event not more than twenty (20) days after receipt of the Indemnitee’s original notice) notify the Indemnitee in writing that it acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to the Claim pursuant to this Article 13 and of its intention either to compromise or defend such Claim. Once the Indemnifying Party gives such notice to the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party is not liable to the Indemnitee for the fees of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such defense, other than the Indemnitee’s reasonable out of pocket Third Party expenses related to its investigation and cooperation, except as otherwise provided in the next sentence. As to all Claims as to which the Indemnifying Party has assumed control under this Section 13.3(b), the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of a Claim (as reasonably directed by the Indemnifying Party) at its own expense; provided, however, that if the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded, based upon a written opinion from outside legal counsel, that there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee in the defense of such Claim, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of one (1) law firm serving as counsel for the Indemnitee in relation to such Third Party Claim.(c)Cooperation. The Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its legal representatives in the investigation and defense of any Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnitee informed on a reasonable and timely basis as to the status of such Claim (to the extent the Indemnitee is not participating in the defense of such Claim) and conduct the defense of such Claim in a prudent manner.(d)Settlement. If an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Claim, no compromise or settlement of such Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnitee’s written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee’s consent shall not be required of a settlement where: (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnitee; (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; (iii) the Indemnitee’s rights under this Agreement are not adversely affected; and (iv) there is a full release of the Indemnitee from such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume defense of a Claim within a reasonable time, the Indemnitee may settle such Claim on such terms as it deems appropriate with the consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee for such settlement as provided in this Article 13. It is understood that only Vyera and CytoDyn may claim indemnification under this Agreement (on its own behalf or on behalf of its Indemnitees), and other Indemnitees may not directly claim indemnity under this Agreement.13.4 Insurance. Each Party, at its own expense, shall maintain comprehensive general liability, product liability and other appropriate insurance for the activities such Party undertakes pursuant to this Agreement, from reputable and financially secure insurance carriers in a form and at levels consistent with sound business practice and adequate in light of its obligations under this Agreement. Each Party shall provide a certificate of insurance (or evidence of self-insurance) evidencing such coverage to the other Party upon request. Such insurance will not create a limit to a Party’s liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Article 13 or otherwise. This Section 13.4 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement for the period in which the Licensed Product is being Commercialized by or on behalf of Vyera plus six (6) years. Each Party shall provide the other Party with prompt written notice of any cancellation, non-renewal or material change in such insurance that could materially adversely affect the rights of the other Party hereunder, and shall provide such notice within thirty (30) days after any such cancellation, non-renewal or material change.13.5 Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT FOR A PARTY’S OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE 13, AND ANY BREACH OF ARTICLE 10 (CONFIDENTIALITY), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (OR THE OTHER PARTY’S AFFILIATES OR SUBLICENSEES) IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT FOR LOST REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, LOST ROYALTIES, LOST SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, DAMAGE TO GOODWILL, OR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR INDIRECT DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR STRICT LIABILITY, EVEN IF THAT PARTY HAS BEEN PLACED ON NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. FOR CLARITY AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THIS SECTION 13.5, ROYALTIES AND MILESTONES PAYABLE TO CYTODYN IN CONNECTION WITH VYERA’S COMMERCIALIZATION OF LICENSED PRODUCTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT COULD CONSTITUTE DIRECT DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT AWARDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 12.ARTICLE 14MISCELLANEOUS14.1 Notices. All notices and other communications given or made pursuant hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given on the date delivered, if delivered personally, or on the next Business Day after being sent by reputable international overnight courier (with delivery tracking provided, signature required and delivery prepaid), in each case, to the Parties at the following addresses, each as may be specified below (or at such other address for a Party as shall be specified by notice given in accordance with this Section 14.1).If to Vyera:Vyera Pharmaceuticals, LLC600 Third Avenue, 10th FloorNew York, NY 10016Attention:   Legal DepartmentEmail:         [***]with a copy to:Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP101 Park AvenueNew York, NY 10178-0060Attention:   [***]Email:        [***]If to CytoDyn:CytoDyn Inc.1111 Main Street, Suite 660Vancouver, WA 98660Attention:  Nader Pourhassan, CEOEmail:         [***]with a copy to:Lowenstein Sandler LLPOne Lowenstein DriveRoseland, NJ 07068Attention: [***]Email: [***]14.2 Governing Law. This Agreement and all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any breach hereof shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law principles that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement14.3 Designation of Affiliates. Each Party may discharge any obligation and exercise any right hereunder through delegation of its obligations or rights to any of its Affiliates. Each Party hereby guarantees the performance by its Affiliates of such Party’s obligations under this Agreement, and shall cause its Affiliates to comply with the provisions of this Agreement in connection with such performance. Any breach by a Party’s Affiliate of any of such Party’s obligations under this Agreement shall be deemed a breach by such Party, and the other Party may proceed directly against such Party without any obligation to first proceed against such Party’s Affiliate.14.4 Relationship of the Parties. It is expressly agreed that CytoDyn, on the one hand, and Vyera, on the other hand, shall be independent contractors and that the relationship between the two Parties shall not constitute a partnership, joint venture or agency, including for tax purposes. Neither CytoDyn nor Vyera shall have the authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action which shall be binding on the other, without the prior written consent of the other Party to do so. All persons employed by a Party shall be employees of that Party and not of the other Party and all costs and obligations incurred by reason of such employment shall be at the expense of such Party.14.5 Force Majeure. Both Parties shall be excused from the performance of their obligations under this Agreement to the extent that such performance is prevented by Force Majeure and the nonperforming Party promptly provides notice of the prevention to the other Party. Such excuse shall be continued so long as the condition constituting Force Majeure continues and the nonperforming Party takes reasonable efforts to remove the condition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party shall not be excused from making payments owed hereunder because of a Force Majeure affecting such Party. If a Force Majeure persists for more than [***], then the Parties shall discuss in good faith the modification of the Parties’ obligations under this Agreement in order to mitigate the delays caused by such Force Majeure.14.6 Assignment. Vyera may not assign this Agreement, or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of CytoDyn, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed provided that Vyera may assign this Agreement without CytoDyn’s consent to an Affiliate or to a successor to substantially all of the business of Vyera to which this Agreement relates. A Change of Control shall be deemed an assignment for purposes of this Agreement. Any permitted successor or assignee of rights and/or obligations permitted hereunder shall, in writing to the other Party, expressly assume performance of such rights and/or obligations. Any permitted assignment shall be binding on the successors of the assigning Party. Any assignment or attempted assignment by Vyera in violation of the terms of this Section 14.6 shall be null, void and of no legal effect. For clarity, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Vyera from undergoing any Change of Control, but if Vyera undergoes a Change of Control, it will be subject to Section 2.6. CytoDyn may assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole but not in part, to any Third Party not in a materially worse (financially and otherwise) of performing CytoDyn’s obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Vyera (it being understood that any other assignment of this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder shall require the prior written consent of Vyera, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).14.7 Severability. If any one (1) or more of the provisions of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal can be or is taken, the provision(s) shall be considered severed from this Agreement and shall not serve to invalidate any remaining provisions hereof. The Parties shall make a good faith effort to replace any invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision such that the objectives contemplated by the Parties when entering this Agreement may be realized.14.8 Waiver and Non-Exclusion of Remedies. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. The waiver by either Party hereto of any right hereunder or of the failure to perform or of a breach by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any other right hereunder or of any other breach or failure by such other Party whether of a similar nature or otherwise. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and do not exclude any other right or remedy provided by Applicable Law or otherwise available except as expressly set forth herein.14.9 Further Assurance. Each Party shall duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly executed and delivered, such further instruments and do and cause to be done such further acts and things, including the filing of such assignments, agreements, documents, and instruments, as may be necessary or as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with this Agreement or to carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes hereof.14.10 Headings. The headings of each Article and Section in this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to limit or expand on the meaning of the language contained in the particular Article or Section.14.11 Construction. Except where the context otherwise requires, wherever used, the singular shall include the plural, the plural shall include the singular, and the use of any gender shall be applicable to all genders. Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days without using a term otherwise defined herein, such number refers to calendar days.

Each Party represents that it has been represented by legal counsel in connection with this Agreement and acknowledges that it has participated in the drafting hereof. In interpreting and applying the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Parties agree that no presumption will apply against the Party which drafted such terms and provision.14.12 Entire Agreement.

GassTitle:President and Chief Executive OfficerTHE BOEING COMPANYBy:Name:Joseph T. LowerTitle:Vice President, Corporate and Strategic Development10Annex ADispute Resolution Procedures(a) In the event of any controversy or claim between the Parties arising out of, relating to or in connection with any provision of this Agreement, or the rights or obligations of the Parties hereunder, the Parties shall try to settle their differences amicably between themselves.(b) Either Party may initiate such informal dispute resolution by sending written notice of the dispute to the other Party, and within 10 days after such notice, senior management level representatives of the Parties, or other representatives of the Parties who have been delegated authority to resolve the dispute, shall meet, in person or by telephone, for attempted resolution by good faith negotiations. If such representatives do not resolve such dispute within 45 days of receipt of the dispute notice for any reason, the Parties agree to seek the assistance of the members of the Board of Directors of ULA in resolving the dispute; provided that the Parties shall not be bound by any decision of the Board of Directors. If the Parties have not resolved the dispute within 30 days after seeking the assistance of the Board of Directors of ULA, then the Parties agree to submit the dispute to final and binding arbitration before a panel of three arbitrators in New York, New York under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA Rules”).(c) Arbitration will be commenced by a Party filing a demand for arbitration pursuant to the AAA Rules (an “Arbitration Demand”). That Party also shall send a copy of the Arbitration Demand to the other Party. Each Party to the dispute shall select an arbitrator within 10 days of the date of the Arbitration Demand and shall so notify the other Party in writing, or, if a Party to the dispute fails to select an arbitrator within such 10 day period, the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) shall make such appointment within five days thereafter and shall notify the Parties in writing. Within 10 days from their appointment, the two arbitrators thus appointed shall select a third arbitrator, who shall act as the chairman of the panel, and shall notify the Parties in writing of his or her selection. If the two arbitrators fail to agree on a third arbitrator within 10 days of their selection, the AAA shall make the appointment within five days thereafter and shall notify the Parties in writing. If an arbitrator so selected becomes unable to serve, his or her successors shall be similarly selected or appointed.(d) The arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act and such procedures as the Parties may agree, or, in the absence of such agreement, pursuant to the AAA Rules. The arbitrators will agree to comply with the Federal Arbitration Act and the procedures agreed to by the Parties, or if applicable, the AAA Rules (including any and all of the time deadlines governing the arbitrators’ conduct set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act, the procedures agreed to by the Parties and the AAA Rules, as applicable) and the terms of this Annex A. The arbitrators shall have case management authority and shall resolve the dispute in final within 180 days from the commencement of the arbitration. In the event the arbitrators fail to resolve the dispute in final within 180 days from the commencement of the arbitration, either Party may serve a written notice to the arbitrators and to the other Party that requires the arbitrators to resolve the dispute in final within 30 days of service of such written notice, provided that if the Party not serving the written notice asserts that the failure to resolve the dispute within such 180-day period was due to delay by the Party serving the written notice, such30-day period shall be extended by the number of days, if any, that the arbitrators (by written decision issued within such 30-day period) determine the Party serving the written notice was dilatory. If the arbitrators fail to resolve the dispute within such 30 (or extended) - day period, either Party may remove the case from arbitration and file the action as a lawsuit in accordance with Section 5.14 of this Agreement. In the event a Party removes the case from arbitration pursuant to the provisions hereof, each Party hereby waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to such removal or that such dispute continues to be subject to arbitration. For purposes of calculating the effects of any statutes of limitations, any lawsuit initiated pursuant to this provision will be deemed to have been filed on the date that the arbitration was commenced, as established by the Federal Arbitration Act or the AAA Rules, if applicable.(e) The Parties agree that each shall have the right to conduct discovery and present evidence in accordance with the following rules. Each Party shall be allowed to conduct reasonable discovery through written document requests and depositions, the nature and extent of which discovery shall be determined by the Parties; provided, that if the Parties cannot agree on the terms of discovery, the nature and extent thereof will be determined by the arbitrators who will take into account the needs of the Parties and the purposes of arbitration to make discovery expeditious and cost effective. Access to any confidential or proprietary financial or other information produced in discovery will be limited to the discovering Party’s lawyers and other experts and a limited number (to be agreed by the Parties) of senior managers of the discovering Party, who will be obligated to preserve the confidentiality of such information on reasonable and customary terms. Each Party shall provide to the other, reasonably in advance of the hearing, copies of all documents which a Party intends to present at the hearing. Each Party shall be entitled to make an oral presentation to the arbitrators.(f) The Parties agree that a judgment may be entered on the arbitrators’ award in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrators in reviewing any claim under this Agreement shall have the exclusive authority to determine any issues as to the arbitrability of any such claim or related disputes hereunder. In reaching a decision, the arbitrators shall interpret, apply and be bound by this Agreement and by Applicable Law. The arbitrators shall have no authority to add to, detract from or modify this Agreement or any Applicable Law in any respect. The arbitrators may grant any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could grant, except that the arbitrators may not grant any relief or remedy greater than that sought by the Parties, nor any special, indirect, punitive or consequential damages, including lost profits and opportunity costs (except in each case to the extent assessed in connection with claims by other Persons).(g) Any up-front costs of the arbitrators shall be borne equally by the Parties engaged in such dispute; provided, however, that the non-prevailing Party in any such arbitration shall pay, and to the extent applicable reimburse the prevailing Party for, the costs and expenses of the arbitrators, including costs and expenses payable to the AAA and to the arbitrators; and provided further, that in the event each Party prevails as to certain claims in connection with any such arbitration, the fees of the arbitrators shall be paid and/or reimbursed in accordance with the decision of the arbitrators. Each Party shall bear its own costs incurred in connection with attorneys’ fees and related expenses.(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Annex A, (i) nothing in this Agreement shall limit or in any way restrict the ability of any Party to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court or other judicial body, and (ii) this Annex A shall not apply to, and the Parties shall have no obligation to submit to arbitration, any deadlock of the Members on any matter requiring unanimous consent of the Members under the Operating Agreement, including pursuant to Section 7.02(b) of the Operating Agreement, or any Board deadlock on any matter requiring approval by majority vote of the entire Board, including pursuant to Section 6.02(b)(ii) of the Operating Agreement.'}}]}}"

Confidentiality(a) Definition of Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means (a) any technical and non-technical information related to Company’s business and current, future and proposed products and services of Company, including for example and without limitation, Company Property (as defined in Section 5(d)), and Company’s information concerning research, development, design details and specifications, financial information, procurement requirements, engineering and manufacturing information, customer lists, business forecasts, sales information and marketing plans and (b) any information that may be made known to Advisor and that Company has received from others that Company is obligated to treat as confidential or proprietary.(b) Non-Disclosure and Nonuse Obligations. During Advisor's independent contractor relationship under this Agreement, Company shall provide to Advisor Confidential Information. In exchange for the Company's promise to provide Advisor with Confidential Information, and except as permitted in this Section 5(b), Advisor shall not use, disseminate or in any way disclose the Confidential Information. Advisor may use the Confidential Information solely to perform services pursuant to this Agreement for the benefit of Company. Advisor shall treat all Confidential Information with the same degree of care as Advisor accords to Advisor’s own confidential information, but in no case shall Advisor use less than reasonable care. If Advisor is not an individual, Advisor shall disclose Confidential Information only to those of Advisor’s employees who have a need to know such information. Advisor certifies that each such employee will have agreed, either as a condition of employment or in order to obtain the Confidential Information, to be bound by terms and conditions at least as protective as those terms and conditions applicable to Advisor under this Agreement. Advisor shall immediately give notice to Company of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. Advisor shall assist Company in remedying any such unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. Advisor agrees not to communicate any information to Company in violation of the proprietary rights of any third party.(c) Exclusions from Non-Disclosure and Nonuse Obligations. Advisor’s obligations under Section (b) shall not apply to any Confidential Information that Advisor can demonstrate (a) was in the public domain at or subsequent to the time such Confidential Information was communicated to Advisor by Company through no fault of Advisor; (b) was rightfully in Advisor’s possession free of any obligation of confidence at or subsequent to the time such Confidential Information was communicated to Advisor by Company; or (c) was developed by employees of Advisor independently of and without reference to any Confidential Information communicated to Advisor by Company. A disclosure of any Confidential Information by Advisor (a) in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body or (b) as otherwise required by law shall not be considered to be a breach of this Agreement or a waiver of confidentiality for other purposes; provided, however, that Advisor shall provide prompt prior written notice thereof to Company to enable Company to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent such disclosure.(d) Ownership and Return of Confidential Information and Company Property. All Confidential Information and any materials (including, without limitation, documents, drawings, papers, diskettes, tapes, models, apparatus, sketches, designs and lists) furnished to Advisor by Company, whether delivered to Advisor by Company or made by Advisor in the performance of services under this Agreement and whether or not they contain or disclose Confidential Information (collectively, the “Company Property”), are the sole and exclusive property of Company or Company’s suppliers or customers. Advisor agrees to keep all Company Property at Advisor’s premises unless otherwise permitted in writing by Company. Within five (5) days after any request by Company, Advisor shall destroy or deliver to Company, at Company’s option, (a) all Company Property and (b) all materials in Advisor’s possession or control that contain or disclose any Confidential Information. Advisor will provide Company a written certification of Advisor’s compliance with Advisor’s obligations under this Section 5(d).6. Indemnification.

Observance of Company Rules. At all times while on Company’s premises, Advisor will observe Company’s rules and regulations with respect to conduct, health, safety and protection of persons and property.8. No Conflict of Interest. During the term of this Agreement, Advisor will not accept work, enter into a contract or accept an obligation inconsistent or incompatible with Advisor’s obligations, or the scope of services to be rendered for Company, under this Agreement. Advisor warrants that, to the best of Advisor’s knowledge, there is no other existing contract or duty on Advisor’s part that conflicts with or is inconsistent with this Agreement. Advisor agrees to indemnify Company from any and all loss or liability incurred by reason of the alleged breach by Advisor of any services agreement with any third party.29. Reserved.10.

The definitions contained in this Agreement and the rights and obligations contained in this Section 10(d) and Sections 5 and 11 will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.11. General Provisions(a) Successors and Assigns. Advisor may not subcontract or otherwise delegate Advisor’s obligations under this Agreement without Company’s prior written consent. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be for the benefit of Company’s successors and assigns, and will be binding on Advisor’s assignees.(b) Injunctive Relief. Advisor’s obligations under this Agreement are of a unique character that gives them particular value; Advisor’s breach of any of such obligations will result in irreparable and continuing damage to Company for which money damages are insufficient, and Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief and/or a decree for specific performance, and such other relief as may be proper (including money damages if appropriate).(c) Notices. Any and all notices, requests, demands, or other communications provided for hereunder, shall be given in writing by personal service, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, overnight delivery service, delivery charges prepaid, or by email, facsimile or other electronic means addressed to the intended recipients. A notice shall be deemed to have been received when personally served or delivered or five (5) days after being mailed, or one (1) day after being sent by overnight delivery service or by email, facsimile or other electronic means.3(d) Governing Law; Forum. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the United States of America and by the laws of the State of Texas, as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Texas between Texas residents. Each of the parties irrevocably consents to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Texas, as applicable, for any matter arising out of or relating to this Agreement, except that in actions seeking to enforce any order or any judgment of such federal or state courts located in Texas, such personal jurisdiction shall be nonexclusive. Additionally, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, a claim for equitable relief arising out of or related to this Agreement may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.(e) Severability. If a court of law holds any provision of this Agreement to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) that provision shall be deemed amended to achieve an economic effect that is as near as possible to that provided by the original provision and (b) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.(f) Waiver; Modification. If Company waives any term, provision or Advisor’s breach of this Agreement, such waiver shall not be effective unless it is in writing and signed by Company. No waiver by a party of a breach of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach by Advisor. This Agreement may be modified only by mutual written agreement of authorized representatives of the parties.(g) Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relating to this subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements concerning such subject matter, written or oral.[SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS]4IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.COMPANYPEDEVCO CORP.By: /s/ Clark R.
