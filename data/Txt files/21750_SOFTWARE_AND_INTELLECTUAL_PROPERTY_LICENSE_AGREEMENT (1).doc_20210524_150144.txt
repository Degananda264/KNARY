10.1      Put Option. Subject to the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 10.2, upon the delivery of a written notice by Licensor to AVST (the “Put Notice”), Licensor may elect to sell all of the UCN IP Assets to AVST (the “Put Option”) in exchange for the Purchase Price (as defined in Section 10.3).

10.2      Condition to Exercise of Put Option.

(a)

An initial payment of 530,539 shares (subject to adjustment as set forth in Exhibit D) of Series 1 Preferred, to be paid on the Put Option Date;

11

(b)

Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Section 10.3(b), an earnout payment equal to 1,193,712 shares (subject to adjustment as set forth in Exhibit D) of Series 1 Preferred (the “First Performance Earnout”), to be paid in installments (each installment, an “Earnout Payment”) as follows:

(i)

one-third of the First Performance Earnout, to be paid to Licensor if AVST's gross revenues, calculated in accordance with GAAP, generated by the Business exceed $500,000 during the year ending December 31, 2011;

(ii)

one-third of the First Performance Earnout to be paid to Licensor if AVST's gross revenues, calculated in accordance with GAAP, generated by the Business exceed $1,500,000 during the year ending December 31, 2012; and

(iii)

one-third of the First Performance Earnout to be paid to Licensor if AVST's gross revenues, calculated in accordance with GAAP, generated by the Business exceed $3,500,000 during the year ending December 31, 2013; and

(c)

Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Section 10.3(c), a second earnout payment equal to 1,193,712 shares (subject to adjustment as set forth in Exhibit D) of Series 1 Preferred (the “Second Performance Earnout”), to be paid upon the successful execution of a long-term distribution agreement with one or more of the hosted communications service providers listed on Schedule 10.3(c); provided that such distribution agreement is executed prior to 180 days after the Effective Date.

10.4      Earnout Payments. Each Earnout Payment under the First Performance Earnout, if paid, will be paid to Licensor on the later of (I) 20 business days from the date on which the financial statements for the applicable Earnout Payment period become available or (II) the Put Option Date. The Second Performance Earnout, if paid, will be paid to Licensor on the later of (A) the Put Option Date or (B) the date of the execution of the distribution agreement referenced in Section 10.3(c). On the date on which an Earnout Payment is made, AVST will (a) deliver to Licensor an income statement showing in reasonable detail the true and complete computations made in calculating the gross revenues generated by the Business during the applicable year, and (b) pay the Earnout Payment to Licensor by delivering a stock certificate evidencing the applicable shares of the Series 1 Preferred Stock of AVST. The income statement submitted by AVST will (x) be true, complete, accurate and correct in all material respects, (y) be prepared in accordance with GAAP, and (z) fairly and accurately present in all material respects the results of operations of the Business during the covered period.

10.5      Disputes. In the event of any dispute, claim, question or disagreement arising from or relating to an Earnout Payment or the Second Performance Earnout, the Parties will use all reasonable efforts to settle the dispute, claim, question or disagreement. To that end, the Parties will consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to both Parties. If they do not reach such a solution within a period of 30 days, then, upon notice by either Party to the other, all disputes, claims, questions or differences with respect to an Earnout Payment will be finally settled by binding arbitration in accordance with Section 14.3.

12

10.6      Covenants With Respect to Earnout Payments. AVST acknowledges and agrees that the ability of the Business to generate sufficient revenues to entitle Licensor to an Earnout Payment, and the ability of the Parties to calculate fairly and measure the performance of the Business, will depend upon maintaining the Business as a whole and as a discrete business unit during the periods subject to an Earnout Payment (collectively, the “Earnout Period”). Accordingly, AVST will (a) act in good faith during the Earnout Period, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts in operating the Business during the Earnout Period, (c) maintain separate books and records relating to the gross revenues of the Business sufficient to allow preparation of an independent audit of its gross revenues throughout the Earnout Period, (d) account for such items on a basis consistent with AVST's operations in the Business in the ordinary course as determined by AVST in its discretion, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied in the United States, and (e) produce financial statements within three months of a period ending.

11.    AVST OPTION TO PURCHASE

11.1      Option to Purchase. At or prior to the end of the License Period, AVST may, in its sole discretion and subject to any required approval by the Licensor’s shareholders (“Shareholder Approval”) and Exchange, purchase the UCN IP Assets for the Purchase Price set forth in Section 10; provided, however, that the First Performance Earnout and the Second Performance Earnout will not be paid until earned in accordance with this Agreement. If Shareholder Approval is required, AVST will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide any information needed by Licensor to obtain Shareholder Approval.

12.4      Termination for Failure to Pay Five Year Payment. Licensor may terminate this Agreement at any time after the five year anniversary of this Agreement upon providing thirty (30) days written notice to AVST, if AVST has not paid the Five Year Payment to the Licensor. Termination under this Section 12.4 will become effective at the expiration of this thirty (30) day period if AVST has not paid the Five Year Payment within such cure period. Termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.4 will be Licensor's sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by AVST to pay the Five Year Payment. This Section 12.4 shall in no way limit the rights of the Licensor under Section 12.3.

12.5      Survival. The rights and obligations under Sections 2.3, 6, 9, 13, and 14 will survive the termination of this Agreement.
