3.1              Option Grant and Option Period. Upon Aptose’s payment of the Option Grant Fee, this Article 3 comes into effect for the duration of the Option Period (defined below), and except as expressly set forth in this Article 3, no other provision of this Agreement shall be of any force or effect. CG hereby grants to Aptose an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to Develop and Commercialize Licensed Compounds and Products in the Licensed Territory as set forth in Section 4.4 (the “Option”).

3.7              Exclusivity. CG hereby covenants that, during the Option Period, neither it nor its Affiliates will (a) grant or offer any license or other rights to a Third Party, or otherwise discuss or negotiate with any Third Party the terms of any license or rights, (b) conduct any activities, whether independently or with or for the benefit of a Third Party, or (c) file any patent applications, in each case (a)-(c) with respect to the research, development, manufacture or commercialization of any Competing Product.

3.8              Option Exercise.

(a)               Payment or Issuance of Shares. At any time prior to the expiration of the Option Period, Aptose may by giving written notice to CG exercise its Option. Promptly thereafter, Aptose shall either (i) pay to CG two million U.S. Dollars ($2,000,000) in cash, (ii) issue to CG the equivalent of two million U.S. Dollars ($2,000,000) of common stock of Aptose in accordance with Applicable Laws, or (iii) pay to CG one million U.S. Dollars ($1,000,000) in cash and issue to CG the equivalent of one million U.S. Dollars ($1,000,000) of common stock of Aptose in accordance with Applicable Laws ((i), (ii) or (iii), as applicable, the “Option Exercise Fee”), and the election of clause (i), (ii) or (iii) will be at Aptose’s sole discretion. Upon such payment and/or issuance, Aptose will be granted the license set forth in Section 4.4 (Commercial License Grant) below, and the Parties will enter the License Period. The deemed value per share of such common stock (the “Shares”) will equal the volume weighted average trading price of the common stock of Aptose on the Toronto Stock Exchange (calculated by dividing the total value of common stock traded by the total volume of common stock traded for the applicable period) for the ten (10) trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date of issuance, and the number of shares to be issued to CG shall equal one million U.S. Dollars ($1,000,000) or two million U.S. Dollars ($2,000,000), as applicable, divided by such deemed value per share, rounded up to the nearest whole number. For clarity, the license grant in Section 4.4 (Commercial License Grant) constitutes the consideration for the Shares, and no other purchase price shall be payable.

14

(b)              Representations and Warranties. In connection with the issuance of the Shares upon Aptose’s exercise of the Option, Aptose hereby represents, warrants and, as applicable, covenants to CG, as of the Effective Date, that:

4.3              Right of First Refusal. The Parties acknowledge and agree that after the Option Period, CG’s obligations under Section 3.7 (Exclusivity) above will expire, and CG shall thereafter be relieved of all restrictions concerning development and commercialization of Competing Products and shall be free to, and regain the right to, research and develop Competing Products. CG hereby grants to Aptose a right of first refusal, during the first two (2) years of the License Period, to obtain an exclusive (even as to CG), worldwide license (with the right to grant sublicenses through multiple tiers) to research, develop, make, have made, use, import, export, offer for sale, sell and otherwise commercialize Competing Products in the Field (“Aptose’s Right of First Refusal”). Within five (5) days after the earlier of (a) CG’s receipt of an inquiry, unsolicited offer or proposal from a Third Party with respect to a Competing Product, or (b) CG’s decision that it wishes to commence discussions with a Third Party with respect to a Competing Product, CG shall notify Aptose in writing of such Competing Product (the “CG Notice”) and shall provide Aptose with a reasonably detailed summary of all information in CG’s possession or readily available to CG with regard to such Competing Product. Aptose shall have sixty (60) days after its receipt of the CG Notice and related information to evaluate such information and to notify CG whether or not Aptose wishes to negotiate with CG regarding rights to develop and commercialize such Competing Product. If Aptose so notifies CG of its exercise of Aptose’s Right of First Refusal, then the Parties shall exclusively negotiate in good faith to seek to agree upon the terms and conditions of an agreement under which CG would grant to Aptose exclusive licenses and other rights to develop and commercialize such Competing Product. If Aptose does not notify CG of its interest in such Competing Product during such sixty (60)-day period, or if the Parties do not enter into a written agreement governing such licenses and rights within one hundred eighty (180) days after CG’s receipt of Aptose’s notice of its exercise of Aptose’s Right of First Refusal, or such longer period as may be agreed by the Parties, then CG shall thereafter have the right to initiate or participate in discussions with Third Parties with respect to the development and commercialization of such Competing Product; provided that CG shall not grant any Third Party any rights to develop or commercialize the Competing Product on financial terms that are equally or more favorable to such Third Party than the terms last offered by Aptose, where such “financial terms” are limited to only the upfront payments and development milestone payments (which include all milestone payments based on events occurring prior to Regulatory Approval) without first offering such Third Party terms to Aptose for a period of sixty (60) days. If Aptose notifies CG during such sixty (60)-day period that it accepts such terms, then the Parties will thereafter negotiate and enter into an agreement granting Aptose the right to develop and commercialize the Competing Product consistent with such terms. If Aptose does not notify CG that it accepts such terms during such sixty (60)-day period, then CG may enter into an agreement with the applicable Third Party consistent with the terms offered to Aptose; provided that if CG does not enter into such Third Party agreement with such Third Party, then this Section 4.3 will apply to any further offer from, or discussion or negotiation with, a Third Party with respect to the applicable (and any other newly discovered) Competing Product.

17

4.4              Commercial License Grant. Upon Aptose’s payment of the Option Exercise Fee, CG agrees to grant, and hereby grants, Aptose an exclusive license (even as to CG), with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers in accordance with Section 4.5 (Sublicenses) below, under CG Intellectual Property for the Term of this Agreement to research, Develop, make, have made, use, import, export, offer for sale, sell and otherwise Commercialize Licensed Compounds and Products in the Field in the Licensed Territory.

Aptose shall have the right to grant sublicenses through multiple tiers under any or all of the rights granted in Section 4.4 (Commercial License Grant) to its Affiliates and to Third Parties; provided that each such sublicense shall be consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Aptose will promptly provide CG with the name and address of any of its Sublicensees. Any sublicense will not relieve Aptose of its obligations to CG under this Agreement. Aptose will be responsible for all obligations under this Agreement applicable to any such Sublicensee, and will remain fully responsible for performance of this Agreement notwithstanding any sublicenses granted.

4.6              CG’s Retained Rights. CG retains all rights not expressly granted to Aptose hereunder including but not limited to the right under CG Intellectual Property to research, Develop, make, have made, use, import, export, offer for sale, sell and otherwise Commercialize Licensed Compounds and Products in the Field in the Retained Territory.

Except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, the Parties agree that, during the Term and for ten (10) years thereafter, the receiving Party shall keep confidential and shall not publish or otherwise disclose and shall not use for any purpose other than as expressly provided for in this Agreement any Confidential Information of the other Party, and both Parties shall keep confidential and, subject to Sections 9.2, 9.3 and 9.5, shall not publish or otherwise disclose the terms of this Agreement. Each Party may use the other Party’s Confidential Information only to the extent required to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, including exercising its rights or performing its obligations. Each Party will use at least the same standard of care as it uses to protect proprietary or confidential information of its own (but no less than reasonable care) to ensure that its employees, agents, consultants, contractors and other representatives do not disclose or make any unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other Party. Each Party will promptly notify the other upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information of the other Party.

9.2              Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Confidential Information shall not include any information that the receiving Party can prove by competent written evidence: (a) is now, or hereafter becomes, through no act or failure to act on the part of the receiving Party, generally known or available to the public; (b) is known by the receiving Party at the time of receiving such information, other than by previous disclosure of the disclosing Party, or its Affiliates, employees, agents, consultants or contractors; (c) is hereafter furnished to the receiving Party without restriction by a Third Party who has no obligation of confidentiality or limitations on use with respect thereto, as a matter of right; or (d) is independently discovered or developed by the receiving Party without the use of Confidential Information belonging to the disclosing Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a receiving Party shall not be liable to the disclosing Party for the use of Residuals (defined below) from Confidential Information of the disclosing Party, provided that the receiving Party no longer has use of or access to any embodiment of such Confidential Information. This right to Residuals does not represent a license under any patents, trade secret rights, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of the disclosing Party. The term “Residuals” means any information that is retained in the unaided memories of the receiving Party’s employees who have had access to the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and who does not and cannot identify such information as the Confidential Information of the disclosing Party.

Any information disclosed pursuant to any such prior agreement shall be deemed Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement.

9.7              Equitable Relief. Given the nature of the Confidential Information and the competitive damage that a Party would suffer upon unauthorized disclosure, use or transfer of its Confidential Information to any Third Party, the Parties agree that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Article 9.

(e)               Provided a Party has made a sufficient showing under the rules and standards set forth in the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and applicable case law, the arbitrators shall have the freedom to invoke, and the Parties agree to abide by, injunctive measures after either Party submits in writing for arbitration claims requiring immediate relief. Additionally, nothing in this Article 13 will preclude either Party from seeking equitable relief or interim or provisional relief from a court of competent jurisdiction, including a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other interim equitable relief, concerning a dispute either prior to or during any arbitration if necessary to protect the interests of such Party or to preserve the status quo pending the arbitration proceeding.

44

(f)                The arbitration proceeding will be confidential and the arbitrators shall issue appropriate protective orders to safeguard each Party’s Confidential Information. Except as required by Applicable Laws, no Party shall make (or instruct the arbitrators to make) any public announcement with respect to the proceedings or decision of the arbitrators without prior written consent of the other Party. The existence of any dispute submitted to arbitration, and the award, shall be kept in confidence by the Parties and the arbitrators, except as required in connection with the enforcement of such award or as otherwise required by Applicable Laws.

(g)               Any duty to arbitrate under this Agreement shall remain in effect and be enforceable after termination of this Agreement for any reason.

(h)              Any dispute, controversy or claim relating to the validity, enforceability or inventorship of any patents or trademarks shall be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction in the country in which such patent or trademark rights were granted or arose.

Exhibit B

Assay Protocols for Competing Product

Protocol to assess in vitro enzymatic potency against a standard panel of kinases as typically used by a commercial testing laboratory that routinely performs such tests as part of its commercial services offering. Additionally, assay results are to be rejected and re-performed if the measured IC50 values are lower than 50% of the enzyme concentration used.

If there is a dispute between the Parties as to whether a product satisfies the definition of Competing Product (as set forth in Section 1.19 above), such product will be submitted to an independent Third Party testing laboratory selected from the list of approved laboratories set forth below or as mutually agreed upon by the Parties at such time, and have such testing laboratory perform the test per the protocol guidelines set forth in this Exhibit B. The Parties will share equally the cost of such testing.
