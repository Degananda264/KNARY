5.2                                 The Consultant and the relevant Consultant Affiliate shall not be liable for any failure in performing any obligations under this Agreement to the extent that such failure is due to the failure by HSBC or the relevant HSBC Group Member to perform an obligation under this Agreement.

5.3                                 With respect to Fixed-price Engagements and Not-to-exceed Engagements only, in the event that HSBC or the relevant HSBC Group Member fails to meet its obligations as stated in this Agreement (and the Consultant or the relevant Consultant Affiliate has previously notified HSBC or the relevant HSBC Group Member in writing of HSBC’s or the relevant HSBC Group Member’s failure to perform such obligations and the Consultant’s or the relevant Consultant Affiliate’s entitlement to claim for Lost Time in accordance with this clause 5.3 if HSBC’s or the relevant HSBC Group Member’s failure to perform continues), and Consultant or the relevant Consultant Affiliate incurs additional time, effort or expense in the course of delivering the Services due solely to such failure by HSBC or the relevant HSBC Group Member (“Lost Time”), then Consultant or the relevant Consultant Affiliate shall inform HSBC or the relevant HSBC Group Member in writing of the amount of the Lost Time and provide sufficient evidence to justify its claim under this clause 5.3 and any further evidence requested by HSBC or the relevant HSBC Group Member, and on HSBC’s or the relevant HSBC Group Member’s satisfaction of Consultant’s or the relevant Consultant Affiliate’s entitlement to claim for the amount of Lost Time under this clause 5.3, HSBC or the relevant HSBC Group Member shall reimburse Consultant or the relevant Consultant Affiliate an equitable amount at the standard rates which apply to the relevant SoW for such Lost Time.

6.4.1                        to reject the Deliverable and terminate the relevant SoW (in full or in part) on notice with immediate effect, in which case the Consultant or the relevant Consultant Affiliate shall refund to HSBC or the relevant HSBC Group Member all Charges paid by HSBC or the relevant HSBC Group Member in relation to such Deliverable and HSBC or the relevant HSBC Group Member shall return to Consultant or the relevant Consultant Affiliate the applicable Deliverable and all related materials supplied by Consultant or the relevant Consultant Affiliate; or

6.4.2                        to accept the Deliverable subject to a reasonable deduction of Charges (which amount of deduction has been agreed between the parties) to reflect the delays caused by its failure to meet the Acceptance Tests, and/or the reduced level of functionality and performance (or other aspects) of the Deliverable; or

6.4.3                        to require the Consultant or the relevant Consultant Affiliate to continue to use Best Endeavours to remedy the defect and re-present the Deliverable for further Acceptance Testing.

6.5                                 If any Acceptance Test is repeated because a Deliverable failed to pass the Acceptance Test when previously tested and to the extent that such failure arose due to the Consultant’s or the

14

relevant Consultant Affiliate’s default in not developing the Deliverable to fulfil the requirements set out in the relevant SoW and/or Specification, the Consultant or the relevant Consultant Affiliate shall promptly pay on demand HSBC’s or the relevant HSBC Group Member’s additional expenses (including any internal expenses relating to wasted time, as well as third party expenses) in repeating the Acceptance Tests.

6.6                                 Nothing in this clause 6 shall affect any rights or remedies of HSBC or any HSBC Group Member under clause 4.

its affected personnel to other projects and clients during any such postponement or suspension, and that such personnel may no longer be available to perform Services if/when HSBC or the relevant HSBC Group Member desires to re-commence the Services.  Consultant and Consultant Affiliates shall have no liability for the unavailability of personnel as a result of any SoW postponement or suspension hereunder except that when the Services are re-commenced on prior reasonable notice from HSBC, Consultant and Consultant Affiliates shall provide personnel (“Replacement Personnel”) to replace the affected personnel and such Replacement Personnel shall have at least the same level of skills and qualifications as the personnel that they have replaced.

18.9                           HSBC acknowledges that where the Consultant has undergone its annual fee review during the period of suspension, then any re-instatement of that SoW shall, subject to negotiation, be subject to a revision of the previously agreed Charges to take into account the increase in fees.

18.10                     On receipt of the HSBC’s or the relevant HSBC Group Member’s instructions under clause 18.7, the Consultant or the relevant Consultant Affiliate shall be entitled to payment for Services completed to the reasonable satisfaction of HSBC or the relevant HSBC Group Member’s up to the time that the notice takes effect and in respect of any costs and expenses reasonably and properly incurred by the Consultant or the relevant Consultant Affiliate relating to the equipment, materials, personnel or services obtained or ordered wholly or substantially in connection with performing the Services which cannot reasonably be defrayed elsewhere.

18.11                     Termination of any part of this Agreement shall not affect rights accrued prior to termination.

19                                  FORCE MAJEURE

Neither party and no HSBC Group Member or Consultant Affiliate shall be liable to the other for any delays or failures attributable to any Event of Force Majeure (other than delays or failures caused by a party’s contractors or agents, for which the delaying party shall be responsible), save that the delaying party shall use its Best Endeavours to resume performance as quickly as possible and shall promptly give the other party full particulars of the failure or delay and consult with the other party concerning the failure or delay from time to time as appropriate.  If any such failure or delay continues for a period of three (3) months or any sixty (60) days in a one hundred and twenty (120) day period the non-delaying party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement immediately on giving to the other written notice.

27

20                                  ESCALATION

20.1                           If any relevant HSBC Group Member commits any act that would constitute a material breach by HSBC of the terms of the Agreement, then Consultant (or at Consultant’s discretion Kanbay) will notify HSBC and the relevant HSBC Group Member in writing of such breach.

20.2                           If the breach is not remedied within fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt of such notification by HSBC and the relevant HSBC Group Member (whichever is later), then Consultant (or at Consultant’s discretion Kanbay) shall be entitled to demand a meeting with a senior representative of HSBC (and, at HSBC’s option, the relevant HSBC Group Member) at which the parties will in good faith attempt to resolve any outstanding breach.

21                                  DISPUTES

21.4                           Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the costs of any mediation carried out pursuant to this clause shall be shared equally between the parties.
