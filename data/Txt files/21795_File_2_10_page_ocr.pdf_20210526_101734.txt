its own expense, any claim, suit, action or proceeding (each a
“Claim”) brought against Licensee to the extent it is based
upon a claim that any Licensed Software, Documentation or
C-Lutions Technology licensed pursuant to this Agreement
or provided by C-Lutions infringes upon any patent or any
copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property or other
proprietary right of any third party. Licensee agrees that it
shall notify C-Lutions in writing of any such Claim and give
C-Lutions reasonable information and assistance in
connection therewith. C-Lutions shall have the sole right to
control the defense of any such Claim and the sole right to
settle or compromise any such Claim, provided that any such
settlement or compromise that involves anything other than a
cash payment by C-Lutions to the claimant shall not
adversely affect the rights of Licensee as provided herein. C-

expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) awarded to
third parties against Licensee or incurred by Licensee in

claim of infringement to the extent such Claim is based on (a)
use of a C-Lutions Technology outside the scope of this
Agreement; (b) use of a superseded or altered release of a C-
Lutions Technology if the infringement would have been
avoided by the use of a later unaltered release of the C-
Lutions Technology provided to Licensee.; (c) the
combination, operation, or use of a C-Lutions Technology
with other software, hardware or other materials not
approved by C-Lutions if such infringement would have been
avoided by avoiding the use of the C-Lutions Technology
with such software, hardware or other materials; ; (d) any
modification of the C-Lutions Technology made by a third
party; or (e) Licensee’s use of the C-Lutions Technology

ENTIRE LIABILITY OF C-LUTIONS TO LICENSEE

5. WARRANTY

5.1 Licensed Software Warranty. C-Lutions warrants that for
a period of sixty (60) days from the date of delivery (the
“Warranty Period”), the Licensed Software will operate
substantially in accordance with the applicable
Documentation. C-Lutions does not warrant that the
functions contained in the C-Lutions Technology will meet
Licensee’s requirements or that the operation of the C-
Lutions Technology will be uninterrupted or error free. If,
during the Warranty Period, the Licensed Software does not
operate substantially in accordance with such
Documentation, Licensee may so inform C-Lutions in
writing and provide to it, such information and materials as
C-Lutions may reasonably request to document and
reproduce such problem and to verify whether any proposed
solution corrects such problem. Such information may
include a written explanation of such problem, a written
description of the operating environment, and (if permitted) a
copy of any software program used with the C-Lutions
Technology. Following the receipt of such information and
materials, if C-Lutions determines that the Licensed Software
does not operate substantially in accordance with such
Documentation, then C-Lutions will at its election, (a)
modify the C-Lutions Technology so that it does operate

Page 3 of 6

substantially in accordance with such Documentation, (b)
replace the Licensed Software with other C-Lutions products
offering substantially similar functionality or, (c) if (a) or (b)
is not commercially reasonable, refund any and all fees paid
by Licensee to C-Lutions in connection with the C-Lutions
Technology.. In the event C-Lutions furnishes a correction or
cure pursuant to clause (a) or (b), C-Lutions shall warrant
such correction or cure for the remainder of the original
Warranty Period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.
This Warranty shall not apply to Software that has been
modified by a third party, used improperly or on an operating
environment inconsistent with recommendations by C-
Lutions set forth in the Documentation.

5,2 If an implied warranty or condition is created by your
state/jurisdiction and federal or state/provincial law prohibits
disclaimer of it, you also have an implied warranty or
condition, BUT ONLY AS TO DEFECTS DISCOVERED
DURING THE PERIOD OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY.
AS TO ANY DEFECTS DISCOVERED AFTER THE
SIXTY (60) DAY PERIOD, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. Some states/jurisdictions
do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty or
condition lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
Any supplements or updates to the Product, including
without limitation, any (if any) service packs or hot fixes
provided to you after the expiration of the sixty (60) day
Limited Warranty period are not covered by any warranty or
condition, express, implied or statutory.

5.3 Exclusions. C-Lutions will have no responsibility,
warranty or other obligations whatsoever with respect to: (a)
the use of C-Lutions Technology in a manner inconsistent
with the respective Documentation or this Agreement, (b)

third party, or (c) failure of a C-Lutions Technology as a
result of Licensee’s gross negligence, accident, abuse or
misapplication, or computer equipment malfunction.

5.4 Limited Media Warranty. C-Lutions represents and
warrants that the media, if any, on which the Licensed

Software is furnished will be free from defects in material
and workmanship under normal use for a period of sixty (60)
days from the date of delivery of the C-Lutions Technology
to Licensee.

5.5 Licensed Hardware Warranty. C-Lutions warrants that
for a period of one (1) year from the date of delivery (the
“Licensed Hardware Warranty Period”), the Licensed
Hardware (if applicable) licensed hereunder as part of the C-
Lutions Technology will operate substantially in accordance
with the respective Documentation, subject to the restrictions
of Clauses 5.2 and 5.3.

5.6 No Other Warranties. THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES

negotiate, in good faith, a substitute, valid and enforceable
provision or agreement that most nearly affects their intent in
entering into this Agreement.

7.10No Waiver. A waiver of a breach or default under this
Agreement shall not be a waiver of any other breach or
default. Failure of either party to enforce compliance with

waiver of such term or condition unless accompanied by a
clear written statement that such term or condition is waived.

7.11No_Assignment. This Agreement and the rights
hereunder are not transferable or assignable without the prior
written consent of the parties hereto, provided that Licensee
