10.           INDEMNITY

10.1         Indemnity.

10.1.1      By Biosite. Biosite shall defend, indemnify and hold Beckman harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) resulting from all claims, demands, actions and other proceedings by any third party to the extent arising from (a) the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Biosite under this Agreement, or (b) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Biosite in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

10.1.2      By Beckman. Beckman shall defend, indemnify and hold Biosite harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) resulting from all claims, demands, actions and other proceedings by any third party to the extent arising from (a) the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Beckman under this Agreement, or (b) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Beckman in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

10.2         Procedure. A party (the “Indemnitee”) that intends to claim indemnification under this Section 10 shall promptly notify the other party (the “Indemnitor”) of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding for which the Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification. The Indemnitor shall have the right to assume and control the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnitor; provided, however, that the Indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel to participate in the defense, subject to Indemnitor’s right to control the defense. The indemnity obligations under this Section 10 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding if such settlement is effected without the prior express written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The failure to deliver notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable time after notice of any such claim or demand, or the commencement of any such action or other proceeding, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such claim, demand, action or other proceeding, shall relieve such Indemnitor of any liability to the Indemnitee under this Section 10 with respect thereto, but the omission so to deliver notice to the Indemnitor shall not relieve it of any liability that it may have to the Indemnitee otherwise than under this Section 10. The Indemnitor may not settle or otherwise consent to an adverse judgment in any such claim, demand, action or other proceeding, that diminishes the rights or interests of the Indemnitee without the prior express written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnitee, its employees and agents, shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitor and its legal representatives in the investigation of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding covered by this Section 10.

THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL BE DEEMED TO APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDIES. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THEY HAVE FULLY CONSIDERED THE FOREGOING ALLOCATION OF RISK AND FIND IT REASONABLE, AND THAT THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS ARE AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
