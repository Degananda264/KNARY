GRANT OF LICENSE

1.1        Exclusive Product License. ELITE hereby grants to EPIC a license (“License” or “Licensing Rights”) without the right to further sublicense, to manufacture, market and sell the Exclusive Products as listed in Schedule A in the United States, including the right to reference the ANDA Number, where appropriate, for approval to market the Products in the United States.

1.2        Non-Exclusive Products License. ELITE hereby grants to EPIC a non-exclusive license (“Non-Exclusive License” or “Non-Exclusive Licensing Rights”) without the right to further sublicense, to manufacture, market and sell the Non-Exclusive Products as listed in Schedule D in the United States, including the right to reference the ANDA Number, where appropriate, for approval to market the Non-Exclusive Products in the United States. ELITE shall be the only other company allowed to manufacture, market and sell the Non-Exclusive Products and ELITE shall only sell to clinics. EPIC shall not share in any profits from Non-Exclusive Products sold by ELITE.

1.3        Marketing Rights. ELITE hereby grants to EPIC exclusive marketing rights (“Marketing Rights”) to market and sell the Products in the United States, and Puerto Rico). ELITE agrees that it shall not (and it shall not authorize, permit or suffer any of its affiliates to), directly or indirectly, sell or distribute a Product in United States at any time during the term of this agreement unless specifically authorized or excluded under the terms of this Agreement

1.4        Trademarks. EPIC agrees and acknowledges that it shall not acquire by virtue of this Agreement any interest in any trademarks or trade names of ELITE.

1.5        Manufacturing. ELITE hereby grants to EPIC rights to manufacture the Products for marketing and sales of the Products by EPIC in the United States and Puerto Rico.

2

1.6        Regulatory and Pharmacovigilance. EPIC shall be responsible for all regulatory and pharmacovigilance matters related to these Products.

1.7        Licensed Trade Secrets. The information exchanged between ELITE and EPIC pursuant to this Agreement is expressly subject to the Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement entered into by the parties and dated October 8, 2008 (the “Confidentiality Agreement”) and whose term is hereby made coterminous with this Agreement.

1.8        Improvements. Any new information, developments, or improvements relating to the Products subject to this Agreement, and any patent or copyright rights arising from or related thereto (collectively, “Improvements”) will be owned solely by ELITE but shall be automatically included in the License, and if EPIC develops an Improvement that may be used beyond the Products which are the subject of this Agreement, then ELITE does now automatically grant a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free right for EPIC to use the Improvement.

1.9        Quality Agreement. In conjunction with the execution of this Agreement, the parties shall execute a Quality Agreement.

1.10      Site Transfer. EPIC shall be responsible for all costs related to the site transfer for all Products.

COMPENSATION

2.1.       License Fee, Milestone, and Transfer Cost Payments. In return for the Licensing Rights described in this Agreement, EPIC shall pay to ELITE the milestone payments (“Milestone Payments”) and a license fee (“License Fee”) compensation specified in Schedule B. If ELITE manufactures any product for sale by EPIC, then the transfer cost for the Product shall be $14 per 1000 units in any configuration required by marketing plus the cost of the API at cost (as documented by invoices for the API)

2.2.       Records. EPIC shall keep complete and accurate records of all manufacture and sales of the Products and the calculation of product costs, net sales and gross profit of the Products. EPIC shall also provide a detailed summary of the Cost of Goods for each product on Schedule A. ELITE shall have the right, at ELITE’s expense and after thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to EPIC, through an independent certified public accountant, on a mutually agreeable date, to examine such records at any time within one (1) year after the due date of the License Fee payments to which such records relate, during regular business hours, during the life of this Agreement and for twelve (12) months after expiration of the last production lot of Product sold by EPIC, in order to verify the accuracy of the reports to be made under this Agreement. If the accountant determines that EPIC has under-compensated ELITE, the findings shall be shared with EPIC. If EPIC agrees that EPIC has not paid ELITE all of the compensation ELITE was entitled to receive, or it is later determined that EPIC did not pay all of the compensation due to ELITE, then EPIC shall pay the proper amount of compensation and all costs and expenses incurred by ELITE to hire the accountant and all of the accountant’s expenses, and all legal expenses, to obtain the appropriate compensation. If EPIC disputes in good faith the accuracy of the results of such examination, the parties will retain a second independent certified public accountant whose examination will be binding upon both parties. The losing party will pay all of the expenses of both independent certified public accountant examinations.

(b)

If after twelve (12) months of a Product’s launch, the Gross Profit declines for any Product to the point that the License Fee paid to ELITE is less than $100,000 for a six (6) month period for that Product, then ELITE may terminate the Marketing Rights granted hereunder to EPIC as it relates to that individual Product. If ELITE desires to terminate the Marketing Rights granted hereunder, then ELITE shall give EPIC ninety (90) days written notice that it will no longer have the Marketing Rights to sell the particular Product.

4

If EPIC’s unit volume sales of an API specific group of Products (“ Product Group”), (initially defined as Isradipine, Dantrolene, or Loxapine Product Groups), does not meet its minimum annual unit volume forecast for that Product Group in the initial launch year, or does not meet its subsequent minimum annual unit volume forecast (as defined in Schedule C) for a Product Group, then EPIC shall have the following six (6) months to achieve one-half of the prior year’s minimum annual unit volume forecast and if EPIC still fails to meet such volume minimum during the six months described, then EPIC shall lose its Marketing Rights of such Product Group.

3.3.       Termination by Mutual Agreement. The parties may terminate this Agreement any time by mutual written agreement.

3.4.       Termination by Breach. Upon the breach or default in the performance or observance of any of the material provisions of this Agreement by either Party, when such breach or default is not cured by the responsible Party within sixty (60) days after written notice by the other Party, the other Party may terminate this Agreement upon an additional thirty (30) days written notice to the other Party. Termination will be without prejudice to either Party to recover any and all damages to which it may be entitled, or to exercise any other remedies.

3.5.       Termination by ELITE Upon Bankruptcy or Reorganization of EPIC. If EPIC enters into any proceeding (whether voluntary or otherwise) in bankruptcy, reorganization or arrangement for the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take possession of its assets, or any other proceeding under any law for the relief of creditors or makes an arrangement for the benefit of its creditors, and remains in such proceeding for 30 days, then ELITE shall retain its rights to the Products and may terminate this Agreement without further payment to EPIC.

3.6.       Licensing Rights upon Termination.

3.7.       Accrued Rights. Expiration or termination of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to the right of either Party to receive all payments accrued and unpaid at the effective date of such expiration or termination, without prejudice to the remedy of either Party in respect to any previous breach of the representations, warranties or covenants herein contained, without prejudice to any rights to indemnification set forth herein and without prejudice to any other provision hereof which expressly or necessarily calls for performance after such expiration or termination. EPIC expressly retains the right to sell Product on-hand after termination of this Agreement and shall remain bound to pay ELITE the Licensing Fee as provided in this Agreement.

3.8.       Transition. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason or if EPIC loses its Marketing Rights for any or all Products, or if EPIC stops selling for any reasons, EPIC then shall be required to contract manufacture at cost plus 10% for a three (3) year period from the date the termination occurs or the date the selling ends whichever comes first.

5.3.       Procedures for Indemnification. In the event that a party (the "Indemnified Party") is seeking indemnification under Sections 5.1 or 5.2, the Indemnified Party shall inform the other party (the "Indemnifying Party") of a claim as soon as reasonably practicable after the Indemnified Party receives notice of the claim, shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume direction and control of the defense of the claim, and shall cooperate as requested by the Indemnifying Party (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party) in the defense of the claim; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action or on behalf of the Indemnified Party. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to any pending or threatened action or claim whatsoever, in respect of which indemnification could be sought under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 (whether or not the Indemnified Party is an actual or potential party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party.

8

5.6.       Insurance. Each party shall maintain commercial general liability insurance through the term of this Agreement upon launch of the first Product, which insurance shall afford limits of not less than $5,000,000 for each occurrence for personal injury or property damage liability. Furthermore, each party shall maintain product liability insurance, through the term of this Agreement upon launch of the first Product and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, which insurance shall afford limits of not less than $5,000,000 in the aggregate per annum with respect to product and completed operations liability. This insurance shall be written to cover claims incurred, discovered, manifested, or made during or after the expiration of this Agreement. Each party shall provide the other with a certificate of insurance evidencing the above and showing the name of the issuing company, the policy number, the effective date, the expiration date and the limits of liability. The insurance certificate shall further provide for a minimum of thirty (30) days' written notice to the insured of a cancellation of, or material change in, the insurance. If a party is unable to maintain the insurance policies required under this Agreement through no fault on the part of such party, then such party shall forthwith notify the other party in writing and the parties shall in good faith negotiate appropriate amendments to the insurance provision of this Agreement in order to provide adequate assurances. In the event that either a customer or an insurer of either party requires such party to increase its insurance limits above the $5,000,000 described above for any policy, then the other party to this Agreement must also match the required insurance increase, so that the parties to this Agreement are carrying the same insurance policy limits. It is the express intention of the parties that the parties shall endeavor to avoid insurance policy limits above $10,000,000.
