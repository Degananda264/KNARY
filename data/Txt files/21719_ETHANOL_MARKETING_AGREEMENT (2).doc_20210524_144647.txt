CONFIDENTIAL

EXHIBIT "A"

1.

Commercial Objective:    To the extent commercially feasible as determined in AREI's good faith judgment in accordance with the provisions of this Exhibit "A", AREI will not disadvantage the Pooled Net Price to be paid VERASUN under the Agreement, as a result of its Purchase/Resale Program.

2.

Defined Terms

"Alliance Partners"—shall mean the group of ethanol producers that have agreed to exclusively commit substantially all of their ethanol production to AREI for purposes of AREI marketing their ethanol.

"Purchase/Resale Program"—shall mean the program administrated by AREI, independent of VERASUN or other Alliance Partners, whereby AREI purchases ethanol from non-Alliance Partners for the purpose of selling to customers, independent of the Pooled Market Alliance Volume.

"Contract Segment"—shall mean the type of ethanol contract used in selling ethanol. Contracts are segmented into the following categories:

Fixed Contracts—whereby a buyer agrees to purchase a volume of ethanol from AREI at a particular time, over a period of time, for a fixed price;

Spot—whereby a buyer agrees to buy a volume of ethanol from AREI at a specific time, or over a period of time, for a price that varies over the term of the contract and is based on a mutually agreed upon market index;

Gas Plus—whereby a buyer agrees to buy a volume of ethanol from AREI at a particular time, or over a period of time, for a price that is determined by the sum of: a gasoline market index (e.g. NYMEX, CARB), plus a fixed amount. The gas plus segment is further segmented by the gasoline market index used in determining the price.

3.

Business Rules

The following describes the business rules AREI will follow and the methodology AREI will employ to measure its performance against the commercial objective set forth above with contracts beginning effective October 1, 2003.

A.

To the extent commercially feasible, AREI will attempt to maintain its total mix of Alliance Partner sales contracts, as follows:

Contract Segment

Low

Target % of

Total Gallons

Sold

High

Fixed Price

20%

33%

45%

Gas Plus

20%

33%

45%

Spot

20%

33%

45%

B.

Prior to entering into a contract for the sale of ethanol of a Contract Segment type specified in 3.A. above originating from the Purchase/Resale Program (a "New Resale Contract") AREI will compare the average netback price (on a cents per gallon basis) being realized from the sale of that portion of the Pooled Market Alliance Volumes being sold under then existing contracts of the same Contract Segment (with such average netback price to be calculated on the same basis as the Net Pooled Price, except limited to the specific Contract Segment type at issue) (herein the "Alliance Contract Segment Net Pooled Price") against the average net back price (on a cents per gallon basis before purchase/resale margin) being realized from the sale of that portion of the quantities of ethanol being purchased under the Purchase/Resale

Program and being sold under then existing contracts of the same Contract Segment under the Purchase/Resale Program (with such average netback price to be calculated on a basis similar to that used in calculating the Net Pooled Price except using Purchase/Resale Program volumes rather than Pooled Market Alliance Volumes). Where a New Resale Contract will be a Gas Plus Contract Segment type, only contracts having the same gasoline index will be used in making the above comparison. Whenever possible and to the extent commercially feasible, AREI will only enter into a New Resale Contract of a particular Contract Segment type when the then existing Purchase/Resale Contract Segment Net Pooled Price before purchase/resale margin (after including such New Resale Contract) will be less than or equal to the then existing Alliance Contract Segment Net Pooled Price, both as determined on the basis of then existing contracts of the same Contract Segment type.

C.

AREI may still enter into Purchase/Resale Program contracts for good commercial reasons.

4.

Reporting

AREI will monitor the activities set forth in 3. above and report monthly by Contract Segment to VERASUN on:

•

Alliance Ethanol Average Market Price

•

Breakdown of Pooled Costs

•

Pooled Net Price

•

Pooled Market Alliance Volumes

•

Average Purchase/Resale Market Price

•

Breakdown of Purchase/Resale Costs

•

Average Purchase/Resale Net Price Before Margin

•

Purchase/Resale Volume

•

Differences by Contract Segment of Alliance Ethanol Average Market Price and Pooled Net Price compared to Average Purchase/Resale Market Price and Average Purchase/Resale Net Price

5.

Revisions

—AREI shall have the right to amend or eliminate this Exhibit "A" (a "Contract Change") subject to the following:

A.    Any such Contract Change shall require VERASUN's written consent, with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. For purposes of the foregoing, VERASUN shall not withhold its consent to any amendment to this Exhibit "A" as long as such amendment will not have, in VERASUN's reasonable judgment, an adverse economic effect on VERASUN under the Agreement.

B.    VERASUN shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of AREI's written notice of a proposed Contract Change to notify AREI in writing of whether or not VERASUN consents to such Contract Change. If VERASUN notifies AREI in writing within such thirty (30) day period of its consent to such Contract Change or fails to provide written notice to AREI within such thirty (30) day period of its non-consent to such Contract Change then such Contract Change shall be effective as of the date set forth in AREI's written notice; provided, however, if such Contract Change will not have an adverse economic effect on VERASUN under the Agreement it shall also be effective as of the date set forth in AREI's written notice, whether or not such consent is given by VERASUN.

C.    Subject to B. above, if VERASUN provides written notice of its non-consent to the Contract Change within thirty (30) days of its receipt of AREI's written notice of such Contract Change, then the Contract Change shall not be effective.
