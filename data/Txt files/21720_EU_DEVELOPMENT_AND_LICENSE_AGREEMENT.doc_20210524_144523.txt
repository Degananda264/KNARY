(c) If the actual COGS (ex works in the United States in bulk form) is in excess of the base transfer price of $[***] (the “Target Price”) Pfenex shall be responsible for [***]% of the COGs in excess of the Target Price and Alvogen shall be responsible for [***]% of the COGS in excess of the Target Price. The Target Price will be adjusted annually based on the percentage increase or decrease in the most recent calendar year [***]. If at any time either Party receives, or makes a good faith determination based on any then-available information (including forecasts and pricing) that Pfenex will likely receive [***] percent ([***]%) [***] of the Gross Profit (taking into account any Target Price adjustment under this Section 4.4(c)), then such Party may provide a written notice to the other Party regarding such situation (such notice, “Low Profit Notice”). Upon the other Party’s receipt of a Low Profit Notice, the Parties will meet and discuss in good faith equitable adjustments to the sharing of the Gross Profit for the current and future Quarterly Periods. If the Parties do not agree on such adjustments within thirty (30) days of a Low Profit Notice, either Party may provide a termination notice to the other Party referencing this Section 4.4(c) and stating that such first Party seeks to terminate the Agreement. Promptly after delivery of such termination notice by Pfenex, or receipt by Pfenex of a termination notice from Alvogen, Pfenex shall offer execution of an agreement for the Product in the Territory to Alvogen’s Sublicensee (“New Agreement”) by delivery of a written notice setting out proposed terms, which shall never be more beneficial to Alvogen’s Sublicensee than the terms in this Agreement (“ROFR Notice”). Pfenex shall deliver copy of such ROFR Notice to Alvogen. For a period of thirty (30) days from Alvogen’s receipt of the ROFR Notice (“Exercise Period”), Sublicensee shall be entitled to express its interest in execution of the New Agreement by delivery of a written notice to Pfenex (“Exercise Notice”). If Sublicensee delivers Exercise Notice to Pfenex, Sublicensee and Pfenex shall enter into good faith negotiations with the aim of executing the New Agreement within ninety (90) days, or any other longer period agreed between Sublicensee and Pfenex (“Negotiation Period”). If Sublicensee fails to confirm interest in execution of the New Agreement within the Negotiation Period, or fails to deliver such Exercise Notice within the Exercise Period, this Agreement shall be terminated and termination consequences as stipulated in Section 10.6 shall apply. Furthermore, Pfenex shall be entitled to offer execution of an in-license agreement for the Product in the Territory to Third Parties under terms which, for a period of twelve (12) months after the end of the Negotiation Period will not be more beneficial to such Third Parties than the terms of this Agreement.

(d) If Sublicensee and Pfenex sign the New Agreement, this Agreement shall be terminated and termination consequences stipulated in Section 10.6 shall apply. Furthermore, Pfenex shall pay to Alvogen [***] percent ([***]%) royalty calculated on Pfenex’s Profit Share or other considerations received from sale of Products in the Territory throughout the term of the New Agreement (“Royalty”). Sections 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9 shall apply to Royalty payable by Pfenex to Alvogen even after termination of this Agreement, throughout the term of the New Agreement.

(e) Within sixty (60) days following the end of each Quarterly Period following the First Commercial Sale, Alvogen shall pay to Pfenex all amounts payable pursuant to this Section 4.4 by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by Pfenex.

Section 4.5 Reports. With respect to every Quarterly Period for which Alvogen is obligated to make any payments under Section 4.4, Alvogen shall furnish to Pfenex a written report

for such Quarterly Period within thirty (30) days after the end of such Quarterly Period showing in reasonably specific detail:

(a) the total gross amounts invoiced for Product sold by all Selling Persons and the calculation of Net Sales for Product during such Quarterly Period, including amounts deducted by category from gross amounts invoiced to arrive at Net Sales;

(b) a reasonably detailed calculation of the COGs for Product invoiced during such Quarterly Period;

(c) calculation of Gross Profit;

(d) any Sublicense Consideration; and

(e) the total amounts due to Pfenex under Section 4.4.

Section 4.6 Payment Terms. All payments under this Agreement shall be made in Dollars and, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be non-refundable and non-creditable. Any payments or portions thereof due hereunder which are not paid when due shall bear interest equal to the lesser of the rate equal to the thirty (30) day effective federal fund rate (EFFR) for the date that payment was due, as published by The Wall Street Journal, Internet Edition at www.wsj.com in the “Money Rates” column, plus an additional two hundred (200) basis points, or the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, calculated on the number of days such payment is delinquent. This Section 4.6 shall in no way limit any other remedies available to either Party.

Section 4.7 Records; Audit Rights. Alvogen shall, and shall cause other Selling Persons to, maintain complete and accurate books and records, in sufficient detail to confirm the accuracy of payments and costs with respect to payments under this Agreement (the “Product Financial Records”). Alvogen shall retain all Product Financial Records for a period of at least three (3) years or for such longer period to the extent required by Applicable Law. During such period, upon the written request of Pfenex, the Product Financial Records shall be subject to inspection and audit by and at the expense of Pfenex no more than two times in any Annual Period, unless for cause. Such audits shall occur upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours by an independent auditor selected by Pfenex and reasonably acceptable to Alvogen. Pfenex shall treat all information received or subject to review under this Section 4.7 as Confidential Information of Alvogen in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII. Pfenex shall cause its independent auditor to enter into a confidentiality agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Alvogen, to maintain such records and information of Alvogen in confidence in accordance with Article VIII and not use such records or information except to the extent permitted by this Agreement, including any enforcement of the provisions hereof. If any such audit reveals that Alvogen has failed to accurately make any payment required under this Agreement, then Alvogen shall promptly pay to Pfenex any underpaid amounts due under this Agreement, together with interest calculated as set forth in Section 4.6, or Pfenex shall promptly pay to Alvogen any overpaid amounts paid under this Agreement, as the case may be. If any such audit reveals an underpayment of amounts due under this Agreement greater than five percent (5%) of the amounts actually due for any Annual Period, then Alvogen shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in conducting such audit.

Section 4.8 Costs. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each Party shall bear all costs and expenses of carrying out those activities allocated to it hereunder, including the costs and expenses of its Affiliates and Third Parties acting on its and its Affiliates’ behalf or under their authority.

Section 4.9 Annual Reconciliation and True-up. Certain payments and measurement periods in this Agreement are based on Quarterly Periods, including but not limited to the Gross Profit and Manufacturing Costs. The Parties shall perform a reconciliation of all such amounts at the end of each Annual Period to determine what such amounts would have been if they had been measured on the basis of an Annual Period (with appropriate adjustments or consolidation of related caps, threshold amounts, and other calculations). If the amount of any such payments that would have been made under this Agreement for such Annual Period would have been different than the payments calculated for the corresponding Quarterly Periods, then the Parties shall adjust the payments in the last Quarterly Period to eliminate such difference. The Parties, through the Executive Steering Committee, shall establish a mechanism and timing to facilitate such reconciliation.

Without limiting the foregoing, any disclosures made pursuant to this Section 6.3 will be structured in a manner so as to provide reasonable access to the applicable information while limiting the risk of adversely affecting the patentability of the subject matter disclosed.

Section 6.4 Third Party Actions.

(a) In the event that any Third Party commences any Action against either Party or any of such Party’s Affiliates alleging that the Product (including the use or the manufacture of Product) infringes any Intellectual Property of such Third Party in the Territory (a “Third Party Action”), the Party against whom such Action is commenced shall provide the other Party prompt written notice thereof, and Alvogen shall have the sole right and responsibility to control the defense of such Third Party Action (including the right to seek any license from such Third Party, or enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to any judgment with respect thereto) at Alvogen’s sole expense.

Alvogen may not settle, compromise or consent to any judgment with respect to any Enforcement Action without the prior written consent of Pfenex, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Alvogen shall not have the right to initiate an Enforcement Action if Pfenex has provided notice to Alvogen stating that, Pfenex has been advised by reputable US or UK patent counsel), (i) the initiation of such Enforcement Action would on balance of probabilities invalidate or materially narrow the claims of any Pfenex Patent and (ii) such invalidation or narrowing would likely have a material adverse impact on Pfenex or its Affiliates ability to enforce its Intellectual Property, Trademarks or the Pfenex Technology; and if possible will share such advice under a Common Interest Agreement.

CONFIDENTIALITY; TAXES; NONSOLICITATION; PUBLICATIONS

Section 8.1 Confidentiality. Each of Pfenex and Alvogen acknowledges that, in the course of discussions and negotiations and performing its obligations hereunder, (a) it has received or may receive information from the other Party and (b) the other Party may disclose to it information, data and processes that such other Party wishes to protect from use by and disclosure to Third Parties (all information described in clauses (a) and (b), unless subject to the Confidentiality Exceptions, “Confidential Information”). Each Party shall retain in confidence all Confidential Information of the other Party and (except as expressly provided herein) shall not (i) use Confidential Information of such other Party for any purpose other than the purposes indicated herein and in connection with the performance of this Agreement or (ii) disclose such Confidential Information to a Third Party other than its Agents without the written consent of such other Party. Confidential Information shall not include information that: (A) is or becomes public knowledge (through no fault of the receiving Party or its Agents); (B) is made lawfully available to the receiving Party, other than under an obligation of confidentiality, by a Third Party that, to the knowledge of the receiving Party, is under no duty of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; (C) is already in the receiving Party’s possession at the time of receipt from the disclosing Party (and such prior possession can be reasonably demonstrated by competent evidence by the receiving Party) other than as a result of disclosure by a Third Party that, to the actual knowledge of the receiving Party, was under a duty of confidentiality to the disclosing Party with respect to such information; or (D) is independently developed by the receiving Party or its Affiliates without the use of or reference to Confidential Information of the other Party (and such independent development can be reasonably demonstrated by competent evidence prepared by the receiving Party) ((A) – (D), collectively, the “Confidentiality Exceptions”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a receiving Party may use and disclose Confidential Information of the other Party (I) to the extent required by Applicable Law; provided, however, that if legally permissible, the receiving Party shall give the disclosing Party advance written notice as promptly as is practicable to permit it to seek a protective order or other similar order, at the disclosing Party’s sole cost, with respect to the disclosure of such Confidential Information, and, thereafter, the receiving Party shall disclose only the minimum Confidential Information that it is advised by counsel is required to be disclosed in order to comply, (II) to the extent such disclosure is reasonably necessary for the Prosecution and Maintenance of Patents (including applications therefor) in accordance with Section 6.3, prosecuting or defending litigation, conducting preclinical or clinical studies, or obtaining and maintaining Regulatory Approvals (including MAA Approval), (III) in communication with consultants and advisors (including financial advisors, lawyers and accountants) and others on a need to know basis, in each case, under appropriate nondisclosure and non-use obligations substantially equivalent to those of this Agreement (provided that the disclosing Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 8.1 by those parties to which it discloses Confidential Information), or (IV) to the extent mutually agreed to by the Parties in writing.

[***]Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted because it is both (i) not material and (ii) would be competitively harmful if publicly disclosed.

32

Section 8.2 Agents. Each of Pfenex and Alvogen shall limit disclosure of the other Party’s Confidential Information to only those of its Affiliates, Sublicensees, directors, managers, officers, employees and others (collectively “Agents”) who are concerned with the performance of this Agreement, have a legitimate need to know such Confidential Information in the performance of their duties and are bound by written obligations of non-disclosure and non-use at least as protective of the disclosing Party and its Confidential Information as the terms hereof. Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of Section 8.1 by its Agents and advisors (including financial advisors, lawyers and accountants) and shall take all reasonably necessary measures to restrain its Agents and advisors (including financial advisors, lawyers and accountants) from unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information.

Section 8.3 Restrictions on Sharing Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither Party shall be obligated pursuant to this Agreement to provide, or grant access to, any information (a) that it reasonably and in good faith considers to be Confidential Information it is prevented from disclosing to the other Party by an enforceable confidentiality agreement with a Third Party and that such Party used Diligent Efforts to obtain the consent of such Third Party to provide or grant access to the other Party, (b) the disclosure of which would adversely affect the attorney-client privilege between such Party and its counsel, or (c) the disclosure of which is not permitted pursuant to any Applicable Law or requirement of a Governmental Authority; provided in each case where information was not provided or access was not granted as would otherwise be required under this Agreement, such Party shall inform the other Party of the reason it was not provided or granted and a description of the specific nature of the applicable information. Following the Effective Date and during the Term, in connection with entering into any material agreement (or material amendment thereof) with any Third Party related to the Business, each Party agrees to use Diligent Efforts to negotiate with such Third Party to include provisions in such agreement (or such amendment) sufficient to allow the other Party to receive relevant Confidential Information of such Third Party.

Section 8.4 Prior LOI. This Agreement supersedes the Prior LOI in their entirety, including with respect to information disclosed thereunder. All information exchanged between the Parties under the Prior LOI shall be deemed Confidential Information of the disclosing Party and shall be subject to the terms of Section 8.1, Section 8.2 and Section 8.3.

Section 8.5 Taxes.

(a) The Parties agree that for U.S. federal income and other tax purposes they will treat the transaction under this Agreement, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, as a collaboration agreement that does not constitute a partnership or a joint venture, and agree to not take (or cause any Person to take), any position on any Tax return or in the course of any audit, examination or other proceeding inconsistent with such treatment, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law and except upon a final determination of the applicable Taxing Authority.

(b) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Party under this Agreement shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law. If any Applicable Law (as determined in the reasonable and good faith discretion of the applicable withholding Party) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax

[***]Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted because it is both (i) not material and (ii) would be competitively harmful if publicly disclosed.

33

from any such payment by any Party, then the applicable Party shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, any amount so deducted or withheld shall be deemed paid to the other Party that was entitled to the payment subject to withholding, shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Taxing Authority in accordance with Applicable Law. To Alvogen’s Knowledge, Applicable Law, does not require Alvogen to withhold any of Taxes from any payment required under this Agreement. To the extent that as a result of any change in any Tax law a payment to Pfenex pursuant to this Agreement becomes subject to U.S. federal or Malta withholding Tax (or to an increased rate of such withholding) after the date hereof, Alvogen shall indemnify Pfenex, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any withholding Taxes imposed on such payment (including U.S. federal or Malta withholding Tax imposed on amounts payable under this Section 8.5(b)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if Pfenex or any Affiliate thereof actually obtains a refund or a credit from any Taxing Authority for any portion of any Tax for which it was indemnified under this Section 8.5(b) by Alvogen, Pfenex shall promptly reimburse Alvogen the amount of such refund or credit; and, upon request by Alvogen, Pfenex shall obtain available refunds or credits with respect to any such Taxes.

(c) Any Assignee shall indemnify the Non-Assigning Party, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 8.5) payable or paid by such Non-Assigning Party or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Non-Assigning Party and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Taxing Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if a Party (the “Taxed Party”) obtains a refund or credit from any Taxing Authority for any portion of any Indemnified Tax paid by the other Party, then the Taxed Party shall promptly reimburse the other Party the amount of such refund or credit (but only to the extent of payments made under this Section 8.5(c) with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund or credit), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such Taxed Party and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant Taxing Authority with respect to such refund or credit), and upon request, the Taxed Party shall use Diligent Efforts to obtain available refunds or credits with respect to any such Indemnified Taxes provided, however, that such Taxed Party, upon the request of such Taxed Party, shall repay to such Taxed Party the amount of refund or credit paid over pursuant to this sentence in the event that such Taxed Party is required to repay such refund or credit to such Taxing Authority.

(d) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, excise, customs, charges, duties, ad valorem, value added, stamp, registration, recording, property and other such similar Taxes (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, Taxes assessed against income), and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) lawfully assessed or charged in connection with any of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (collectively, “Transfer Taxes”) shall be paid and borne 50% by Alvogen and 50% by Pfenex when due, and the Party responsible under such Applicable Law for paying such Transfer Taxes shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and pay such Taxes, and, if required by Applicable Law, the Parties will, and will cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax returns and other documentation.

34

(e) The Parties agree to cooperate with one another and use reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate tax withholding or similar obligations in respect of royalties, milestone payments, and other payments made by Alvogen to Pfenex under this Agreement. Pfenex shall provide Alvogen any tax forms that may be reasonably necessary in order for Alvogen not to withhold tax or to withhold tax at a reduced rate under an applicable bilateral income tax treaty. Each Party shall provide the other with reasonable assistance to enable the recovery, as permitted by applicable Laws, of withholding taxes, value added taxes, or similar obligations resulting from payments made under this Agreement, such recovery to be for the benefit of the Party bearing such withholding tax or value added tax.

Section 8.6 Nonsolicitation. Each Party (for purposes of this Section 8.6, a “Soliciting Party”) agrees that, during the Term, such Soliciting Party will not solicit for employment or consultancy, employ or engage as a consultant or solicit the termination of employment or consultancy with the other Party (a “Solicitation Action”), any individual that at the time of such Solicitation Action (a) is an officer or employee of the other Party or a consultant that is devoting a majority of such individual’s time to the business of the other Party, and (b) is or was actively involved in the other Party’s performance of its obligations hereunder; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (i) any advertisement or general solicitation (or hiring or engagement as an employee or consultant as a result thereof) for employment or consultancy not specifically directed at any such individual, (ii) the hiring or engagement as an employee or consultant of any such individual who initiates employment or consultancy discussions with such Soliciting Party, provided that such initial discussions are not encouraged or solicited by such Soliciting Party, or (iii) any Solicitation Action with respect to any individual following the cessation of such individual’s employment with (or service as a consultant that is devoting a majority of such person’s time to the business of) the other Party without any solicitation or encouragement by such Soliciting Party.

Section 8.7 Public Announcements. Neither Party nor their respective Affiliates shall make any public announcement regarding this Agreement or disclose the terms and conditions of this Agreement to any Third Party without the prior written consent of the other Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except (a) to advisors (including consultants, financial advisors, attorneys and accountants) on a need to know basis, in each case, under circumstances that reasonably protect the confidentiality thereof, (b) to actual and potential (i) licensees and collaborators with respect to Product, and (ii) investors and acquirers of the Business or otherwise a majority of the business or assets of such Party related to this Agreement in connection with negotiations of definitive agreements, under reasonable conditions of confidentiality, or (c) to the extent such disclosure is required by Applicable Law (including securities laws). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) without the prior written consent of the other Party, either Party may (I) file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a Current Report on Form 8-K describing this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (II) file a copy of this Agreement with the SEC as an exhibit to such Current Report on Form 8-K or a subsequent periodic report; provided that the filing Party shall consult with the other Party so as to minimize the necessary disclosure and shall seek confidential treatment of such portions of this Agreement or the terms and conditions thereof as permitted under Applicable Laws, and (B) the Parties agree to issue a joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 8.7. Thereafter, Pfenex and Alvogen may each disclose to

35

Third Parties the information contained in such Current Report on Form 8-K or such press release without the need for further approval by the other Party.

Section 8.8 Publications. Alvogen may publish or present data or results relating to Product in scientific journals with primary circulation in the Territory or at scientific conferences in the Territory, subject to the prior review, comment and approval by Pfenex as set forth in this Section 8.8, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Alvogen shall provide Pfenex with the opportunity to review any proposed abstract, manuscript or presentation which discloses information relating to Product by delivering a copy thereof to Pfenex no less than thirty (30) days before its intended submission for publication or presentation. Pfenex shall have ten (10) days from its receipt of any such abstract, manuscript or presentation in which to notify Alvogen in writing of its approval or any specific objections to the disclosure. In the event that Pfenex has a reasonable basis for objecting to the disclosure, it shall object in writing (with the basis therefor) within such ten (10) day period, and Alvogen will not submit the publication or abstract or make the presentation containing the objected-to information until the Parties have agreed to the content of the proposed disclosure, and if the Parties are unable to agree, the matter shall be referred to the Executive Steering Committee. Alvogen shall delete from the proposed disclosure any Confidential Information of Pfenex upon the request of Pfenex. Alvogen shall delay any proposed disclosure to allow Pfenex sufficient time for the drafting and filing of a patent application directed to any patentable subject matter identified by Pfenex in such proposed disclosure. The Parties agree to take all reasonable steps to address and resolve a notice of objection by Pfenex within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice.

48

(b) If the Indemnifying Party does not object to any claim or claims made in the Indemnification Notice in a written objection (the “Indemnification Objection”) prior to the expiration of twenty (20) Business Days from the Indemnifying Party’s receipt of the Indemnification Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed not to object to the information contained within the Indemnification Notice.

If no resolution is reached, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.4 and Section 12.5.

(c) The Indemnifying Party, if it so elects, may assume and control the defense of a Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party’s expense and shall consult with the Indemnified Party with respect thereto, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume control of such defense if the claim that the Indemnifying Party seeks to assume control of (i) seeks material non-monetary relief, or (ii) involves criminal or quasi-criminal allegations; provided further that Alvogen shall be entitled to assume and control (subject to Pfenex having the right to participate and comment) the defense of Third Party Claims relating to clause (f) of Section 11.2 and clause (f) of Section 11.1) as if it was the Indemnifying Party for such claim. If the Indemnifying Party is permitted to assume and control the defense of a Third Party Claim and elects to do so, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel separate from counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (A) the Indemnifying Party has specifically agreed in writing otherwise, or (B) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party’s counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying Party otherwise has an obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for the related Third Party Claim). If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party may not enter into a settlement or consent to any judgment without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party unless (I) such settlement or judgment involves monetary damages only, all of which will be paid, without limitation, by the Indemnifying Party, and no admission of fault or culpability on behalf of any Indemnified Party, and (II) a term of the settlement or judgment is that the Person or Persons asserting such claim unconditionally and irrevocably release all Indemnified Parties from all liability with respect to such claim; otherwise, the consent of the Indemnified Party shall be required in order to enter into any settlement of, or consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to, any claim (which consent shall not be unreasonably withhold, delayed or conditioned). If the Indemnifying Party does not assume or is not controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim for any reason, then the Indemnified Party may retain counsel of its own choosing, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, and assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to employ counsel separate from counsel employed by the Indemnified Party in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have no obligations with respect to any Losses resulting from the Indemnified Party’s admission, settlement or other communication without the

prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Section 11.4 Limitations on Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any claims an Indemnified Party makes under this Article XI will be limited as follows (except as provided in Section 10.5):

(a) Annual Deductible. The Alvogen Indemnitees shall only be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XI (excluding claims made under clause (f) of Section 11.2 and clause (f) of Section 11.1) for Losses incurred in a given Annual Period to the extent the aggregate amount of such Losses incurred by the Alvogen Indemnitees in such Annual Period and for which the Alvogen Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XI (excluding Losses relating to clause (f) of Section 11.2 and clause (f) of Section 11.1) exceeds [***]% of the aggregate amount paid by Alvogen to Pfenex in such Annual Period. The Pfenex Indemnitees shall only be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XI (excluding claims made under clause (f) of Section 11.2 and clause (f) of Section 11.1) for Losses incurred in a given Annual Period to the extent the aggregate amount of such Losses incurred by the Pfenex Indemnitees in such Annual Period and for which the Pfenex Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XI (excluding Losses relating to clause (f) of Section 11.2 and clause (f) of Section 11.1) exceeds [***]% of the aggregate amount paid by Alvogen to Pfenex hereunder in such Annual Period.

(b) Annual Cap. The aggregate amount of Losses incurred by the Alvogen Indemnitees in a given Annual Period for which the Alvogen Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XI (excluding Loss claims made under clause (f) of Section 11.2 and clause (f) of Section 11.1) shall be limited to an amount equal to [***]% of the aggregate amount paid by Alvogen to Pfenex hereunder in such Annual Period. The aggregate amount of Losses incurred by the Pfenex Indemnitees in a given Annual Period for which the Pfenex Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XI (excluding Loss claims made under clause (f) of Section 11.2 and clause (f) of Section 11.1) shall be limited to an amount equal to [***]% of the aggregate amount paid by Alvogen to Pfenex hereunder in such Annual Period.

(c) No Special or Indirect Damages. Except as arising out of a failure of a Party to pay any amount owed hereunder, or arising as the result of the fraud by a Party, or arising from breach of a Party’s confidentiality obligations in Sections 8.1-8.3 or obligations under Section 2.4, neither Party, nor any of their respective Affiliates, directors, members, officers, employees, subcontractors or agents, shall have, under any legal theory (including contract, negligence and tort liability), any liability to any other Party for any consequential, special, indirect, incidental or punitive damages arising out of or related to breach of this Agreement.

(d) Net of Insurance, Third-Party Recoveries and Tax Benefits. All Losses for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to indemnification under this Article XI shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds actually received by an Indemnified Party from an insurance carrier, Tax benefits, indemnification payments and other third-party recoveries to which any Indemnified Party is entitled in respect of any Losses incurred by such Indemnified

Party. In the event any Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates is entitled to any insurance proceeds, Tax benefits, indemnity payments or any third party recoveries in respect of any Losses (or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto) for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XI, such Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize such proceeds, benefits, payments or recoveries. In the event that any such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries (but not Tax benefits, which shall only result in a one-time reduction in Losses at the time provided for below) are obtained, received or realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the claims to which such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly by the relevant Indemnified Parties of all or the relevant portion of such indemnification payment. For purposes of this Section 11.4(d), any Indemnified Party will be deemed to realize a Tax benefit in respect of any Losses incurred to the extent that the liability for cash income Taxes of the Indemnified Party in the taxable period during which such Losses are incurred (calculated with such Losses excluded) exceeds the actual liability for cash income Taxes of the Indemnified Party for such taxable period (calculated with such Losses included). If any Indemnified Party receives any indemnification payment pursuant to this Article XI, at the election of the Indemnifying Party, such Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnifying Party all of its claims for recovery against third Persons as to such Losses, whether by insurance coverage, contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise but only up to the amount of such indemnification payment.

(e) Mitigation of Losses. An Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XI. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, and shall be afforded the opportunity by the Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably possible, to take all available steps to minimize Losses for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification before such Losses actually are incurred by the Indemnified Party.

Section 11.5 Product Liability Allocation. All Losses relating to the indemnity provisions contained in clause (f) of Section 11.2 and clause (f) of Section 11.1 shall be allocated between Alvogen and Pfenex such that Pfenex bears the Pfenex Profit Share (as in effect in the Quarterly Period when such Losses were incurred) of such Losses and Alvogen bears the remainder of such Losses.

Section 11.6 Cooperation. The Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party Action. At the reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its representatives all reasonable access to the books, records, employees and properties of such Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the matters to which the applicable indemnification claim relates. All such access shall be granted during normal business hours and shall be granted under the conditions which shall not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of such Indemnified Party. Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party may, but are not obligated to, share materials that are privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure under applicable Law. To the extent the defense of any Action presents the need for understanding of materials that are privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure,

[***]Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted because it is both (i) not material and (ii) would be competitively harmful if publicly disclosed.

51

The Parties agree to act in good faith in considering entry into a common interest agreement (or similar agreement) that would facilitate these protected materials to be shared in furtherance of defending the Action.

ARTICLE XII

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 12.1 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be held liable or responsible to the other Party nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement for failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of this Agreement when such failure or delay is caused by or results from the causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party, including: fire, floods, earthquake, tsunami, ice, tornado, hurricane, windstorm, eruption, explosion, sabotage or vandalism, embargoes, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), invasion, domestic or foreign terrorist act, act of a public enemy, insurrections, riots, civil commotions, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances, shortages of materials, failure of utilities, acts of God or acts, omissions or delays in acting by any Governmental Authority (each, an event of “Force Majeure”); provided that such affected Party shall provide the other Party with prompt written notice of the circumstances surrounding such a material failure or delay and will use Diligent Efforts to overcome the difficulties created thereby and to resume performance of its obligations as soon as practicable. If the performance of any such obligation under this Agreement is delayed owing to such a Force Majeure for any continuous period of more than one hundred eighty (180) days, the Parties will consult with respect to an equitable solution, including the possibility of the mutual termination of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the occurrence of an event of Force Majeure shall not relieve any Party from fulfilling any obligation required hereunder; rather, the period for performance of such obligation shall be tolled during the occurrence of such Force Majeure.

Section 12.2 Notices. Any notice, request, approval or consent required or permitted to be given by any Party shall be in writing and shall be to the Parties at the addresses or facsimile number listed below, or such other address or facsimile number as such Party will have last given by notice to the other Party, and shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given when delivered in person, transmitted by electronic mail (receipt verified) or by express courier service (signature required) or five (5) days after it was sent by registered mail, return receipt requested (or its equivalent), provided that no postal strike or other disruption is then in effect or comes into effect within two (2) days after such mailing.

Section 12.5 Arbitration.

(a) If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute under Section 12.4, then the Parties agree that all Disputes of any kind or nature (except those described in Section 12.5(c)) shall be resolved exclusively pursuant to the alternative dispute resolution terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit 12.5; provided that judgment upon any arbitral award may be confirmed and entered by any court having competent jurisdiction over the Parties or their assets. The determination resulting from such alternative dispute resolution shall be final, binding and non-appealable for purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 12.4 and Section 12.5(a), an application for emergency or temporary injunctive relief by any Party shall not be subject to internal dispute

(c) Any Dispute relating to the ownership, scope, validity, enforceability or infringement of any Patent covering the manufacture, use or sale of Product or of any trademark rights relating to any Product shall be submitted to the Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in the country where such Patent or trademark exists.

Pfenex and Alvogen Expand Development and Commercialization Collaboration for PF708, a

Therapeutic Equivalent Candidate to Forteo®/Forsteo®, to the EU, MENA, and ROW

Distribution and Promotion by established regional players Theramex and Tamer Group (SAJA)

- - -

SAN DIEGO, February [XX], 2019 —Pfenex Inc. (NYSE American: PFNX) and Alvogen Ltd. today announced entering into agreements expanding their collaboration to develop and commercialize Pfenex’s lead product candidate, PF708, a proprietary teriparatide therapeutic equivalent candidate to Eli Lilly & Company’s Forteo®/Forsteo®, to the EU, to certain countries in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) the ROW territories (the latter defined as all countries outside of the EU, US and MENA, excluding Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand).. This collaboration leverages Alvogen’s established international experience and expertise in regulatory, IP and supply chain activities, as well as its established network of specialty marketing and sales pharmaceutical companies in these regions. Subject to applicable regulatory approvals, PF708 will be commercialized in Europe and Switzerland by Theramex, a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to Women’s Health, in MENA by SAJA, a Tamer Group company, and in ROW by Alvogen’s current and/or future commercialization partners. Under the terms of the agreements, Alvogen will be responsible for the local activities through Theramex, SAJA and its other commercialization partners and for overseeing any clinical development, regulatory, litigation, commercial manufacturing and commercialization. Pfenex will be eligible to receive additional upfront and milestone payments of $3.5 million for EU and MENA and additional potential milestone payments for ROW. For EU, MENA and ROW, Pfenex may also be eligible to receive a gross profit split of up to 60% on product sales, depending on geography and cost of goods sold.

“Collaborating with Alvogen in Europe, MENA and ROW centralizes the development, regulatory and commercialization activities of PF708 and leverages Alvogen’s global supply chain and market access experience to maximize potential of commercial success in these markets. Combining these operational capabilities with the favorable financial terms of the agreements, makes partnering on regional commercialization for PF708 the optimal strategy,” said Eef Schimmelpennink, Chief Executive Officer of Pfenex. “We believe working with Alvogen, coupled with the established and credible commercial partnerships with Theramex, Tamer Group (SAJA) and its other commercialization partners significantly enhances our commercialization strategy. We chose to expand our relationship with Alvogen on PF708 because the overall deal terms proposed were superior to the other regional players that we considered.”

“We continue to be excited by the market opportunity that PF708 offers as a therapeutic equivalent candidate to Forteo®. We believe this new collaboration in the EU, MENA and ROW will allow us to leverage our commercialization efforts in the U.S. and capture a larger piece of the teriparatide global market, which was approximately $1.6 billion in global sales in 2018,” stated Robert Wessman, Chief Executive Officer of Alvogen.

Anish Mehta, Chief Executive Officer at Theramex said, “As a leading women’s health company, we are delighted to be commercializing Pfenex’s proprietary teriparatide across Europe and Switzerland. The addition of teriparatide to our already broad portfolio of medications for the treatment of osteoporosis reinforces our commitment to helping women manage this potentially debilitating condition.”

“As part of SAJA’s long-stated vision to strategically invest in long-term partnerships with global pharma/biotech companies to bring solutions to patients in the MENA region, we are thrilled to welcome Pfenex/Alvogen as our new collaborator to bring new solutions to patients in the MENA region,” stated Riad Fanus, CEO of SAJA..

PF708 is being developed as a therapeutic equivalent to Forteo®. In December 2018, we submitted our new drug application (NDA) for PF708 to the FDA and the FDA accepted the submission in February 2019, leading to potential launch in the U.S., if approved by regulators, as early as the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to regulatory approval and other factors. The NDA submission for PF708 is based on positive data from the PF708-301 Phase III clinical study announced in 2018, which showed comparable overall profiles between PF708 and Forteo after 24 weeks of daily injection in osteoporosis patients. In addition, the NDA includes data from the PF708-101 study, a single-dose, 2-way crossover study comparing the pharmacokinetics of PF708 and Forteo in healthy subjects.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statement –

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or Pfenex’s future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern Pfenex’s future expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the future potential of Pfenex’s product candidates and the company in general, including future plans to advance, develop, manufacture and commercialize its product candidates in collaboration with Alvogen, Theramex, and Tamer; the potential benefits of the collaboration with Alvogen, Theramex, and Tamer; the possibility of the potential commercial US launch of PF708 as early as the fourth quarter of 2019; Pfenex’s expectations with respect to future market sizes for PF708 and the ability of Pfenex and its collaboration partners to capture a large piece of the market; and Pfenex’s expectations regarding potential future milestones and royalties with respect to PF708. Pfenex’s expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of the uncertainties inherent in the clinical drug development process, including, without limitation, Pfenex’s ability to successfully demonstrate the efficacy and safety of its product candidates; the pre-clinical and clinical results for its product candidates, which may not support further development of product candidates or may require Pfenex to conduct additional clinical trials or modify ongoing clinical trials or regulatory pathways; difficulties in achieving and demonstrating biosimilarity in formulations; Pfenex’s ability to manage operating expenses; Pfenex’s ability to obtain additional funding to support its business activities and establish and maintain strategic business alliances and new business initiatives; Pfenex’s dependence on third parties for development, manufacture, marketing, sales and distribution of products; unexpected expenditures; litigation and other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights, including potential future litigation by Eli Lilly and Company with respect to PF708; and difficulties in obtaining and maintaining intellectual property protection for its product candidates.

Exhibit 12.5

Alternative Dispute Resolution

The Parties recognize that bona fide disputes as to certain matters may arise from time to time during the Term of this Agreement which relate to any Party’s rights or obligations. To have such a dispute resolved by this Alternative Dispute Resolution (“ADR”) provision, a Party first must comply with Section 12.4 of the Agreement to which this is an exhibit. If the matter has not been resolved in accordance with such Section 12.4, a Party may initiate an ADR proceeding as provided herein. The Parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel in such a proceeding.

1. To begin an ADR proceeding, a Party shall provide written notice to the other Party of the issues to be resolved by ADR in accordance with this Exhibit 12.5. Within fourteen (14) days after its receipt of such notice, the other Party may, by written notice to the Party initiating the ADR, add additional issues to be resolved within the same ADR.

2. Unless either Party requests otherwise in writing within the fourteen (14) day period described in Paragraph 1 above, the issue shall be resolved in accordance with the Fast Track Mediation and Arbitration Rules of Procedure as administered by JAMS (formerly known as Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services) (“JAMS”) by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with such rules and subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 3 - 13 below.

3. Within twenty-one (21) days following receipt of the original ADR notice, the Parties shall select a mutually acceptable neutral to preside in the resolution of any disputes in this ADR proceeding (each, a “Neutral”). If the Parties are unable to agree on a mutually acceptable Neutral within such period, a Party may request the President of JAMS, 18881 Von Karman Ave., Suite 350, Irvine, CA 92612, to select a Neutral pursuant to the following procedures:

(a) JAMS shall submit to the Parties a list of not less than five (5) candidates within fourteen (14) days after receipt of the request, along with Curriculum Vitae for each candidate. No candidate shall be an employee, director, or shareholder of any Party or any of their Affiliates. Each candidate submitted by JAMS shall (i) be an attorney licensed to practice law for at least twenty (20) years in the United States; and (ii) have material legal or business experience in the pharmaceutical industry.

(b) Such list shall include a statement of disclosure by each candidate of any circumstances likely to affect his or her impartiality.

(c) Each Party shall number the candidates in order of preference (with the number one (1) signifying the greatest preference) and shall deliver the list to JAMS within seven (7) days following receipt of the list of candidates. If a Party believes a conflict of interest exists regarding any of the candidates, that Party shall provide a written explanation of the conflict to JAMS along with its list showing its order of preference for the candidates. Any Party failing to return a list of preferences on time shall be deemed to have no order of preference.

[***]Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted because it is both (i) not material and (ii) would be competitively harmful if publicly disclosed.

65

(d) If the Parties collectively have identified fewer than three (3) candidates deemed to have conflicts, JAMS immediately shall designate as the Neutral the candidate for whom the Parties collectively have indicated the greatest preference. If a tie should result between two candidates, JAMS may designate either candidate. If the Parties collectively have identified three (3) or more candidates deemed to have conflicts, JAMS shall review the explanations regarding conflicts and, in its sole discretion, may either (i) immediately designate as the Neutral the candidate for whom the Parties collectively have indicated the greatest preference, or (ii) issue a new list of not less than five (5) candidates, in which case the procedures set forth in subparagraphs 2(a)–2(d) shall be repeated.

4. No earlier than forty-five (45) days or later than ninety (90) days after selection, the Neutral shall hold a hearing to resolve each of the issues identified by the Parties. The ADR proceeding shall take place in San Diego, California.

5. At least fourteen (14) days prior to the hearing, each Party shall submit the following to the other Party and the Neutral:

(a) a copy of all exhibits on which such Party intends to rely in any oral or written presentation to the Neutral;

(b) a list of any witnesses such Party intends to call at the hearing, and a short summary of the anticipated testimony of each witness;

(c) a proposed ruling on each issue to be resolved, together with a request for a specific damage award or other remedy for each issue. The proposed rulings and remedies shall not contain any recitation of the facts or any legal arguments and shall not exceed one (1) page per issue.

(d) a brief in support of such Party’s proposed rulings and remedies, provided that the brief shall not exceed thirty (30) double-spaced pages. This page limitation shall apply regardless of the number of issues raised in the ADR proceeding.

Except as expressly set forth in subparagraphs 5(a)–5(d), no discovery shall be required or permitted by any means, including depositions, interrogatories, requests for admissions, or production of documents.

6. The hearing shall be conducted on consecutive days and shall be governed by the following rules:

(a) Each Party shall be entitled to ten (10) hours of hearing time to present its case. The Neutral shall determine whether each Party has had the ten (10) hours to which it is entitled.

(b) Each Party shall be entitled, but not required, to make an opening statement, to present regular and rebuttal testimony, documents or other evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, and to make a closing argument. Cross-examination of witnesses shall occur immediately after their direct testimony. Opening statements,

[***]Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted because it is both (i) not material and (ii) would be competitively harmful if publicly disclosed.

66

closing statements, rebuttal testimony and cross-examination time shall be charged against the Party conducting same.

(c) The Party initiating the ADR shall begin the hearing and, if it chooses to make an opening statement, shall address not only issues it raised but also any issues raised by the responding Party. The responding Party, if it chooses to make an opening statement, also shall address all issues raised in the ADR. Thereafter, the presentation of regular and rebuttal testimony and documents, other evidence, and closing arguments shall proceed in the same sequence.

(d) Except when testifying, witnesses shall be excluded from the hearing until closing arguments.

(e) Settlement negotiations, including any statements made therein, shall not be admissible under any circumstances. Affidavits prepared for purposes of the ADR hearing also shall not be admissible. Live videoconference or telephonic testimony will be permitted at the discretion of the Neutral. The Neutral shall have sole discretion with regards to the exercise of its subpoena powers to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents from Third Parties. As to all other matters, the Neutral shall have sole discretion regarding the admissibility of any evidence.

7. Within ten (10) days following completion of the hearing, each Party may submit to the other Party and the Neutral a post-hearing brief in support of its proposed rulings and remedies, provided that such brief shall not contain or discuss any new evidence and shall not exceed thirty (30) pages. This page limitation shall apply regardless of the number of issues raised in the ADR proceeding.

8. The Neutral shall rule on each disputed issue within twenty-one (21) days following completion of the hearing. Such ruling shall adopt in its entirety the proposed ruling and remedy of one of the Parties on each disputed issue but may adopt one Party’s proposed rulings and remedies on some issues and the other Party’s proposed rulings and remedies on other issues. The Neutral shall not issue any written opinion or otherwise explain the basis of the ruling.

9. The Neutral shall be paid a reasonable fee plus expenses. These fees and expenses, along with the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing Party (including all expert witness fees and expenses), the fees and expenses of a court reporter, and any expenses for a hearing room, shall be paid as follows:

(a) If the Neutral rules in favor of one Party on all disputed issues in the ADR, the losing Party shall pay one hundred percent (100%) of such fees and expenses.

(b) If the Neutral rules in favor of one Party on some issues and the other Party on other issues, the Neutral shall issue with the rulings a written determination as to how such fees and expenses shall be allocated between the Parties. The Neutral shall allocate fees and expenses in a way that bears a reasonable relationship to the outcome of the ADR, with the Party prevailing on more issues, or on issues of greater value or gravity, recovering a relatively larger share of its legal fees and expenses.

[***]Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted because it is both (i) not material and (ii) would be competitively harmful if publicly disclosed.

67

10. The rulings of the Neutral and the allocation of fees and expenses shall be binding, non-reviewable, and non-appealable to the extent allowed by Applicable Law, and may be entered as a final judgment in any court having jurisdiction.

11. Except as provided in paragraph 10 or as required by Applicable Law, the existence of the dispute, any settlement negotiations, the ADR hearing, any submissions (including exhibits, testimony, proposed rulings, and briefs), and the rulings shall be deemed Confidential Information of both Parties. The Neutral shall have the authority to impose sanctions for unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information.

12. The Neutral may not award punitive damages. The Parties hereby waive the right to the award of punitive damages.

13. The hearings shall be conducted in the English language.
