3.2    RESPONSIBILITIES AGREEMENT

SCS Services and Responsibilities

•

SCS will install the purchased Microsoft Business Solutions® Navision software and provide the corresponding services.

SCS will provide implementation and project management assistance for the installation and configuration of Microsoft Business Solutions® Navision software. The overall scope of the project is to provide a live and functioning system, operating on a day-to-day basis with transactions being processed by Obagi personnel. . Based on SCS's best estimate, the parties have mutually agreed to the scope of work and number of hours for completion of the deliverables as set forth in Exhibit C to this agreement and incorporated herein by reference. Based on Exhibit C, SCS shall conduct an initial design phase of a maximum of 150 hours ("Design") followed by an implementation phase ("Implementation"). Once Design is completed, SCS shall provide a final schedule and time estimate for the Implementation ("Final Schedule") that shall not exceed the terms set forth in

1

Exhibit C by more than 10%. If the Final Schedule varies from Exhibit C by more than 10%, the parties agree to use good faith efforts to resolve any fee or cost issue in the Final Schedule. If despite the good faith efforts, the parties have not agreed to a mutually agreeable resolution, either party may immediately terminate this agreement upon written notice. If neither party terminates prior to the Implementation, the Final Schedule will be locked and fixed, and shall be approved in writing by the parties.

•

SCS will make every reasonable effort to complete the services according to the time schedule mutually agreed to by both parties. SCS understands and agrees that providing deliverables and milestones including implementation and support on agreed upon timetables between SCS and Obagi is of key importance. In the event SCS becomes aware, or is informed by Obagi, that an implementation or support deliverable or milestone is in jeopardy of falling short of an agreed upon timetable, SCS will immediately inform Obagi and provide a proposed plan to remedy. Any cost or time incurred by SCS to develop and propose such remedy will not be charged to Obagi. Obagi realizes that potential events beyond SCS's control may cause delays in implementing these services. Additionally, changes to the scope of services above and beyond the work described may cause further delays in project completion. All work will be completed on a best effort basis.

Obagi Responsibilities

The success of the project will greatly depend on Obagi's level of involvement. Some of the responsibilities expected to be performed by Obagi include:

•

Provide management support for the required resources and priorities to complete the project in a timely manner

•

Appoint an Obagi project manager, even if this is only a part-time duty.

•

Given the necessary framework and guidance from SCS, Obagi will take commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the design, compilation, review and final approval of design and enhancement specifications. Delays on the review of designs by Obagi can add considerable time to implementation schedules.

•

Verify proper internal controls are in place considering changes in process and software/hardware requirements

•

Ensure proper enterprise level system security with assistance from SCS

•

After initial implementation by SCS, Obagi will develop and train any additional, new Obagi staff on new processes and procedures, as needed. Obagi may request SCS to provide additional training.

•

Establish and maintain a stable technical infrastructure capable of running Navision

•

Provide reasonable access to staff and management during normal business hours

•

Prepare test scripts under the direction and guidance from SCS

•

After SCS's internal testing, Obagi will assist SCS, by testing system and validating performance from the user perspective

•

Secure ongoing support and Navision software maintenance at the completion of the project from SCS, or provided it does not violate any other terms of this agreement, another certified Microsoft Business Solutions' Navision partner. The lack of follow-up and ongoing support for the software can impact its efficiency.

•

Manage Obagi staff on a daily basis and supervise the operation of the system

•

Complete assigned portions of the work plan

Failure to fulfill these responsibilities in a timely manner may impair our ability to provide service.

4.1    Services and support time will be billed at normal support rates. Itemized invoices for software implementation and support will be provided by SCS to Obagi every week. Invoices will detail what exactly has been consumed in hours as well as any additional work orders and time incurred outside the original implementation design plan. Invoices are due on a thirty-day net basis or as otherwise agreed by Obagi. Obagi may purchase blocks of 100 hours in advance, at the reduced rate per Exhibit A, Plan B. Advance blocks of hours purchased are non-refundable. SCS's weekly invoices will detail implementation/support hours used against blocks of hours on Obagi's account. Should hours on account be exceeded, Obagi will have the option of either purchasing additional blocks of hours in advance or paying the normal implementation and support rates as contained in Exhibit A, Plan A.

4.2    Local travel expenses will not be charged to Obagi. Should SCS and Obagi require additional, non-local, technical expertise for specific implementation/support issues, such reasonable travel expenses will be borne by Obagi but will require advanced, written approval for same by Obagi. In any case, such travel expenses are for the Obagi implementation are not to exceed $5,000.00 without mutual agreement by both parties.

4.3    There are a number of items beyond SCS's and/or Obagi's control which can effect delivery of implementation/support, including but not limited to: hardware problems, labor strikes, equipment failures, acts of God, terrorist threats, increased scope from additional, signed Work Orders, package upgrades or mutually agreed changes in implementation by SCS and Obagi. These are normal and customary in software implementation, development and support. All SCS invoices and outstanding balances as contained herein are due and payable as received. Non-payment will be deemed cause for suspension of SCS services with no fault or liability to SCS.

5.0    QUALITY ASSURANCE—SCS will test and debug all modified software. SCS will not bill Obagi for time required to debug any modifications authored by SCS. Correction of software bugs not authored by SCS will be at normal compensation rates pursuant to Exhibit A.

7.0    WARRANTY—SCS warrants that personalizations, configurations, customizations and/or modifications made solely by SCS shall be free of defects for a period of one year from date of implementation. Customizations or program modifications made by SCS can be of such complexity that they may have errors. If such error is suspected, Obagi shall provide notice to SCS. Upon notice from Obagi, SCS shall take all steps necessary to mitigate the effects of the error. If such error(s) is not remedied within five (5) business days unless mutually agreed to by the parties, Obagi shall have the right to contract with third parties to mitigate any damages resulting from the error.
