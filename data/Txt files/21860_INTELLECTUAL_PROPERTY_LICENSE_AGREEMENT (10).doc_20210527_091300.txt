Effect of Termination. Except as provided for in Section 5, LICENSEE’s payment obligations shall extinguish if this Agreement is terminated. If the Agreement expires without any renewal thereof, then LICENSEE must immediately cease and desist all utilization of the Technology for any purpose whatsoever including to manufacture, distribute or sell End Products, except that LICENSEE may continue to distribute and sell End Products until all finished goods and raw materials inventory that pertain to the Technology have been sold and LICENSEE shall be obligated to pay LICENSOR any related License Fees (as defined in section 5) for such sales. In any event, upon the natural future expiration of all pending and issued patents, as applicable, related to the Technology described herein the License Agreement shall expire and LICENSEE shall have no further payment obligations to LICENSOR.

e)

Change of Control. In the event that LICENSEE is purchased as to 50.1% or more (a “Change of Control”) by any entity, this Agreement remains valid only in relation to those End Products that were in commercial production at the time of Change of Control by LICENSEE on its own behalf or as a contract manufacturer. This Agreement grants no rights to any third party to utilize the benefits of the Technology for any products other than the End Products described within.

5)

Compensation and Payment.

If LICENSEE materially breaches this Agreement, LICENSEE shall remain responsible for any License Fee payments due through the end of the calendar quarter during which such breach occurs. LICENSEE’s failure to pay any portion of the applicable License Fee or any reimbursable expenses when due will be a material breach of this Agreement by LICENSEE. If any payment due to LICENSOR under this Agreement is not paid within thirty (30) days following such Party’s written demand therefore, then such payment shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month from the date such payment was originally due.

The Usage License Fee is payable in arrears and net 30 days after each quarter (for greater certainty the first Usage License Fee would be payable for the quarter April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 no later than July 31, 2020) by LICENSEE to LICENSOR, and shall be subject to certain minimum performance conditions as described in subsection (c) below.

Audit Rights. Upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice, LICENSOR shall have the right, through an independent, certified accounting firm, to examine such records and books of account of LICENSEE as are necessary to verify the accuracy of the Usage License Fee and other payments of LICENSEE under this Agreement. Such right may be exercised only once during any twelve (12) month period. Such examination may be performed during normal business hours at LICENSEE’S major place of business or at such other place as may be agreed upon by the LICENSOR and LICENSEE.

Without limitation of the foregoing, each Party will hold the other Party’s Confidential Information in confidence and will (a) exercise the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent its disclosure as such Party would take to safeguard its own confidential or proprietary information, and (b) limit disclosure of the Confidential Information, including any notes, extracts, analyses or materials that would disclose the Confidential Information, solely to those of its employees who need to know the information for purposes of performing the respective Party’s obligations under this Agreement and who agree to keep such information confidential. Upon termination of this Agreement, each Party shall immediately return all Confidential Information to the other Party and further the LICENSOR shall have the right to conduct an on-site audit of the LICENSEE within three (3) business days of termination to ensure compliance with the terms of this Agreement, at LICENSOR’s expense.

In all cases, the receiving Party will use all reasonable efforts to give the disclosing Party ten (10) days' prior written notice of any disclosure of information under this Agreement.
