RECITALS  
WHEREAS, the Employer desires to employ Employee as its Executive Vice President, General Counsel and 
Secretary, upon the terms and conditions stated herein; and  
WHEREAS, Employee desires to be so employed by the Employer at the salary and benefits provided for 
herein;  
WHEREAS, Employee acknowledges and understands that during the course of his employment, Employee 
has and will become familiar with certain confidential information of the Employer which provides Employer with a 
competitive advantage in the marketplace in which it competes, is exceptionally valuable to the Employer, and is 
vital to the success of the Employer’s business; and  
WHEREAS, the Employer and Employee desire to protect such confidential information from disclosure to 
third parties or its use to the detriment of the Employer; and  
WHEREAS, the Employee acknowledges that the likelihood of disclosure of such confidential information 
would be substantially reduced, and that legitimate business interests of the Employer would be protected, if

following the term of the Agreement, and Employee is willing to covenant that he will refrain from such actions.  
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and of the mutual covenants and agreements 
hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree as follows:

ARTICLE TWO  
COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

an annual base salary (“Base Salary”) at the rate of Two Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($225,000), 
payable in installments as are customary under the Employer’s payroll practices from time to time. The Employer at 
its sole discretion may, but is not required to, review and adjust the Employee’s Base Salary from year to year; 
provided, however, that, except as may be expressly consented otherwise in writing by Employee, Employer may 
not decrease Employee’s Base Salary. No additional compensation shall be payable to Employee by reason of the

Plan shall be fifty percent (50%). Such Bonus shall be determined and paid strictly in accordance with the Annual

insurance, sick days and other employee benefits (collectively “Other Benefits”), all in accordance with the terms 
and conditions of the applicable Other Benefits Plans as in effect from time to time. Nothing in this Agreement shall 
require the Employer to maintain any benefit plan, nor prohibit the Employer from modifying any such plan as it 
sees fit from time to time. It is only intended that Employee shall be entitled to participate in any such plan offered 
for which he may qualify under the terms of any such plan as it may from time to time exist, in accordance with the 
terms thereof.  
2.06 Disability. Any compensation Employee receives under any disability benefit plan provided by Employer 
during any period of disability, injury or illness shall be in lieu of the compensation which Employee would 
otherwise receive under Article Two during such period of disability, injury or sickness.

business or activities in the course of which Employer utilized, developed or otherwise acquired such information or 
materials and which Employee has gathered or obtained (other than on behalf of the Employer) after termination of 
his employment with the Employer from such other public sources by his own expenditure of significant time, effort 
and money after termination of his employment with the Employer. Failure to mark any of the Confidential 
Information as confidential shall not affect its status as part of the Confidential Information under the terms of this 
Agreement.  
3.02 Ownership of Confidential Information. Employee agrees that the Confidential Information is and shall at 
all times remain the sole and exclusive property of Employer. Employee agrees immediately to disclose to Employer

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, every invention, improvement, product, process, apparatus, or 
design which Employee may take, make, devise or conceive, individually or jointly with others, during the period of 
his employment by the Employer, whether during business hours or otherwise, which relates in any manner to the 
business of the Employer either now or at any time during the period of his employment), or which may be related 
to the Employer in connection with its business (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Invention”) shall belong to 
and be the exclusive property of the Employer and Employee will make full and prompt disclosure to the Employer 
of every Invention. Employee will assign to the Employer, or its nominee, every Invention and Employee will 
execute all assignments and other instruments or documents and do all other things necessary and proper to confirm 
the Employer’s right and title in and to every Invention; and Employee will perform all proper acts within his power 
necessary or desired by the Employer to obtain letters patent in the name of the Employer (at the Employer’s 
expense) for every Invention in whatever countries the Employer may desire, without payment by the Employer to 
Employee of any royalty, license fee, price or additional compensation.  
3.03. Non Disclosure of Confidential Information. Except as required in the faithful performance of 
Employee’s duties hereunder (or as required by law), during the term of his employment with Employer and for a 
period after the termination of such employment until the Confidential Information no longer meets the definition 
set forth above  
 
 
3  
 
of Confidential Information with respect to Employee, Employee agrees not to directly or indirectly reveal, report, 
publish, disseminate, disclose or transfer any of the Confidential Information to any person or entity, or utilize for 
himself or any other person or entity any of the Confidential Information for any purpose (including, without 
limitation, in the solicitation of existing Employer customers or suppliers), except in the course of performing duties 
assigned to him by Employer. Employee further agrees to use his best endeavors to prevent the use for himself or 
others, or dissemination, publication, revealing, reporting or disclosure of, any Confidential Information.  
3.04 Protection of Reputation. Employee agrees that he will at no time, either during his employment with the 
Employer or at any time after termination of such employment, engage in conduct which injures, harms, corrupts, 
demeans, defames, disparages, libels, slanders, destroys or diminishes in any way the reputation or goodwill of the 
Employer, its subsidiaries, or their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees, or agents, or the services 
provided by the Employer or the products sold by the Employer, or its other properties or assets, including, without 
limitation, its computer systems hardware and software and its data or the integrity and accuracy thereof.  
3.05 Records and Use of Employer Facilities. All notes, data, reference materials, memoranda and records, 
including, without limitation, data on the Employer’s computer system, computer reports, products, customers and 
suppliers lists and copies of invoices, in any way relating to any of the Confidential Information or Employer’s 
business (in whatever form existing, including, without limit, electronic) shall belong exclusively to Employer, and 
Employee agrees to maintain them in a manner so as to secure their confidentiality and to turn over to Employer all 
copies of such materials (in whole or in part) in his possession or control at the request of Employer or, in the 
absence of such a request, upon the termination of Employee’s employment with Employer. Upon termination of 
Employee’s employment with Employer, Employee shall immediately refrain from seeking access to Employer’s 
(a) telephonic voice mail, E-mail or message systems, (b) computer system and (c) computer data bases and 
software. The foregoing shall not prohibit Employee from using Employer’s public Internet (not intranet) site.  
ARTICLE FOUR  
NON-COMPETE AND NON-SOLICITATION COVENANTS  
4.01 Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation. Employee acknowledges that it may be very difficult for him to 
avoid using or disclosing the Confidential Information in violation of Article Three above in the event that he is 
employed by any person or entity other than the Employer in a capacity similar or related to the capacity in which he 
is employed by the Employer. Accordingly, but subject to the Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct for Attorneys, 
as amended from time to time, Employee agrees that he will not, during the term of employment with Employer and, 
if Employee voluntarily terminates his employment hereunder without Good Reason (as hereinafter defined), or if 
Employer terminates his employment for Cause, for a period of one (1) year after the termination of such 
employment, irrespective of the time, manner or cause of such termination, directly or indirectly (whether or not for 
compensation or profit):  
  
(1)  Engage in any business or enterprise the nature of any part of which is competitive with any part of that of the 
Employer (a “Prohibited Business”); or  
  
(2)  Participate as an officer, director, creditor, promoter, proprietor, associate, agent, employee, partner, consultant, 
sales representative or otherwise, or promote or assist, financially or otherwise, or directly or indirectly own any 
interest in any person or entity involved in any Prohibited Business; or  
  
(3)  Canvas, call upon, solicit, entice, persuade, induce, respond to, or otherwise deal with, directly or indirectly, 
any individual or entity which, during Employee’s term of employment with the Employer, was or is a 
customer or supplier, or proposed customer or supplier, of the Employer whom Employee called upon or dealt 
with, or whose account Employee supervised, for any of the following purposes:  
  
(a)  to purchase (with respect to customers) or to sell (with respect to suppliers) products of the types or kinds 
sold by the Employer or which could be substituted for (including, but not limited to, rebuilt products), or 
 
 
which serve the same purpose or function as, products sold by the Employer (all of which products are 
herein sometimes referred to, jointly and severally, as “Prohibited Products”), or  
 
 
4  
 
(b)  to request or advise any such customer or supplier to withdraw, curtail or cancel its business with the 
 
 
Employer; or  
  
(4)  For himself or for or through any other individual or entity call upon, solicit, entice, persuade, induce or offer 
any individual who, during Employee’ s term of employment with the Employer, was an employee or sales 
representative or distributor of the Employer, employment by, or representation as sales agent or distributor for, 
anyone other than the Employer, or request or advise any such employee or sales agent or distributor to cease 
employment with or representation of the Employer, and Employee shall not approach, respond to, or otherwise 
deal with any such employee or sales representative or distributor of Employer for any such purpose, or 
authorize or knowingly cooperate with the taking of any such actions by any other individual or entity.  
4.02 Obligation Independent Each obligation of each subparagraph and provision of Section 4.01 shall be 
independent of any obligation under any other subparagraph or provision hereof or thereof.  
4.03 Public Stock Nothing in Section 4.01, however, shall prohibit Employee from owning (directly or 
indirectly through a parent, spouse, child or other relative or person living in the same household with Employee or 
any of the foregoing), as a passive investment, up to 1 % of the issued and outstanding shares of any class of stock 
of any publicly traded company.  
4.04 Business Limitation If, at the termination of Employee’ s employment and for the entire period of twelve 
(12) months prior thereto his duties and responsibilities are limited by the Employer so that he is specifically 
assigned to, or responsible for, one or more divisions, subsidiaries or business unites of the Employer, then 
subparagraphs (1) through (3) of Section 4.01 shall apply only to any business which competes with the business of 
such divisions, subsidiaries or business units.  
4.05 Area Limitation If at the termination of Employee’ s employment and for the entire period of twelve (12) 
months prior thereto he or she has responsibility for only a designated geographic area, then subparagraphs 
(1) through (3) of Section 4.01 shall apply only within such area.  
ARTICLE FIVE  
TERMINATION  
5.01 Termination by Employer for Cause. The Employer shall have the right to terminate Employee’s 
employment at any time for “cause.” Prior to such termination, the Employer shall provide Employee with written 
notification of any and all allegations constituting “cause” and the Employee shall be given five (5) working days 
after receipt of such written notification to respond to those allegations in writing. Upon receipt of the Employee’s 
response, the Employer shall meet with the Employee to discuss the allegations.  
For purposes hereof, “cause” shall mean (i) an act or acts of personal dishonesty taken by the Employee and 
intended to result in personal enrichment of the Employee, (ii) material violations by the Employee of the 
Employee’s obligations or duties under, or any terms of, this Agreement, which are not remedied in a reasonable 
period (not to exceed ten (10) days) after receipt of written notice thereof from the Employer, (iii) any violation by 
the Employee of any of the provisions of Articles Three or Four, or (iv) Employee being charged, indicted or 
convicted (by trial, guilty or no contest plea or otherwise) of (a) a felony, (b) any other crime involving moral 
turpitude, or (c) any violation of law which would impair the ability of the Employer or any affiliate to obtain any 
license or authority to do any business deemed necessary or desirable for the conduct of its actual or proposed 
business.  
5.02 Termination by Employer Because of Employee’s Disability, Injury or Illness. The Employer shall have 
the right to terminate Employee’s employment if Employee is unable to perform the duties assigned to him by the 
Employer because of Employee’s disability, injury or illness, provided however, such inability must have existed for 
a total of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days before such termination can be made effective. Any 
compensation Employee receives under any disability benefit plan provided by Employer during any period of 
disability, injury or illness shall be in lieu of the compensation which Employee would otherwise receive under 
Article Two during such period of  
 
 
5  
 
disability, injury or sickness.  
5.03 Termination as a Result of Employee’s Death. The obligations of the Employer to Employee pursuant to 
this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon Employee’s death.  
5.04 Termination by Employer for any Other Reason. The Employer shall have the right to terminate 
Employee’s employment at any time for any reason upon written notice to Employee.  
5.05 Termination by Employee. Subject to the provisions of Articles Three and Four above, Employee may 
terminate his employment by the Employer at any time by sixty (60) days prior written notice to Employer. In such 
event Employer may elect to terminate the employment at any time after receipt of the notice; provided however, for 
compensation purposes, the date of termination shall be the last day of the notice period.  
5.06 Compensation on Termination. If Employee’s employment is terminated under Sections 5.01, 5.02, 5.03, 
5.04 or 5.05 above, the Employer’s obligation to pay Employee’s Base Salary, Auto Allowance and Bonus pursuant 
to the Annual Incentive Plan shall cease on the date on which the termination of employment occurs and shall be 
prorated and accrued to the date of termination, except as expressly provided for below with respect to Sections 5.04 
and 5.05(b). Employer’s obligations and Employee’s rights with respect to Stock Awards, Options and Other 
Benefits shall be governed by the provisions of the plans under which they are granted.  
If Employee’s employment is terminated under Section 5.04 , the Employer shall be obligated to pay to 
Employee an amount equal to his then current annual Base Salary and any earned Bonus for the 12 month period 
ending on the date of termination, which amount shall be paid by Employer in substantially equal installments over 
the period of twelve (12) months after the date on which Employee’s employment is so terminated on the dates 
Employer would normally pay its employees. However, if the Employee is a “Specified Employee”, as defined in 
Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and the regulations promulgated there under, on the date of his termination of 
employment, such amounts otherwise payable within the first six (6) calendar months following the Employee’s 
termination of employment, shall be delayed, to the extent necessary for the Employee to avoid the adverse tax 
consequences imposed under Code Section 409A. On the first business day of the seventh calendar month 
immediately following the Employee’s termination of employment, payment of the aggregate amount of the delayed 
cash payment shall be paid in a lump sum. The remaining installment payments shall be made on the same dates as 
the Employer makes regular payroll payments under its customary practice. Employer’s obligations and Employee’s 
rights with respect to Stock Awards, Options and Other Benefits shall be governed by the provisions of the plans 
under which they are granted and paid or provided to the date on which Employee’s employment is so terminated. 
During the time Employer makes such payments, Employee shall provide such assistance and time as may 
reasonably be required by Employer to effect a smooth transition to the employee(s) assuming Employee’s duties 
and responsibilities.  
ARTICLE SIX  
REMEDIES  
6.01 Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Agreement will not prevent him from 
obtaining such other gainful employment he may desire to obtain or cause him any undue hardship and are 
reasonable and necessary in order to protect the legitimate interests of employer and that violation thereof would 
result in irreparable injury to Employer. Employee therefore acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach 
or threatened breach by Employee of the provisions of Article Three or Article Four or Section 1.03, Employer shall 
be entitled to an injunction restraining Employee from such breach or threatened breach and Employee shall lose all 
rights to receive any payments under Section 5.04. Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting 
Employer from pursuing any other remedies available to Employer for such breach or threatened breach; the rights 
hereinabove mentioned being in addition to and not in substitution of such other rights and remedies. The period of 
restriction specified in Article Four shall abate during the time of any violation thereof, and the portion of such 
period remaining at the commencement of the violation shall begin to run until the violation is cured.  
6.02 Survival. The provisions of this Article Six and of Articles Three and Four shall survive the termination 
or expiration of this Agreement.

ARTICLE SEVEN MISCELLANEOUS  
7.01 Assignment. Employee and Employer acknowledge and agree that the covenants, terms and provisions 
contained in this Agreement constitute a personal employment contract and the rights and obligations of the parties 
thereunder cannot be transferred, sold, assigned, pledged or hypothecated, excepting that the rights and obligations 
of the Employer under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred pursuant to a sale of the business, merger, 
consolidation, share exchange, sale of substantially all of the Employer’s assets or of the business unit or division 
for which Employee is performing services, or other reorganization described in Section 368 of the Code, or through 
liquidation, dissolution or otherwise, whether or not the Employer is the continuing entity, provided that the 
assignee, or transferee is the successor to all or substantially all of the assets of the Employer or of the business unit 
or division for which Employee is performing services and such assignee or transferee assumes the rights and duties 
of the Employer, if any, as contained in this Agreement, either contractually or as a matter of law.  
7.02 Severability. Should any of Employee’s obligations under this Agreement or the application of the terms 
or provisions of this Agreement to any person or circumstances, to any extent, be found illegal, invalid or 
unenforceable in any respect, such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of 
this Agreement, all of which shall remain enforceable in accordance with their terms, or the application of such 
terms or provisions to persons or circumstances other than those to which it is held illegal, invalid or unenforceable. 
Despite the preceding sentence, should any of Employee’s obligations under this Agreement be found illegal, invalid 
or unenforceable because it is too broad with respect to duration, geographical or other scope, or subject matter, such 
obligation shall be deemed and construed to be reduced to the maximum duration, geographical or other scope, and 
subject matter allowable under applicable law.  
The covenants of Employee in Articles Three and Four and each subparagraph of Section 4.01 are of the essence of 
this Agreement; they shall be construed as independent of any other provision of this Agreement; and the existence 
of any claim or cause of action of Employee against the Employer, whether predicated on the Agreement or 
otherwise shall not constitute a defense to enforcement by the Employer of any of these covenants. The covenants of 
Employee shall be applicable irrespective of whether termination of employment hereunder shall be by the 
Employer or by Employee, whether voluntary or involuntary, or whether for cause or without cause.  
7.03 Notices. Any notice, request or other communication required to be given pursuant to the provisions 
hereof shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered in person or three (3) days after 
being deposited in the United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested and 
addressed to the party at its or his last known addresses. The address of any party may be changed by notice in 
writing to the other parties duly served in accordance herewith.  
7.04 Waiver. The waiver by the Employer or Employee of any breach of any term or condition of this 
Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute the waiver of any other breach of the same or any other term or 
condition hereof. Failure by any party to claim any breach or violation of any provision of this Agreement shall not 
constitute a precedent or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breaches hereof.  
7.05 Continuing Obligation. The obligations, duties and liabilities of Employee pursuant to Articles Three and 
Four of this Agreement are continuing, absolute and unconditional and shall remain in full force and effect as 
provided herein and survive the termination of this Agreement.  
7.06 No Conflicting Obligations or Use. Employer does not desire to acquire from Employee any secret or 
confidential know-how or information which he may have acquired from others nor does it wish to cause a breach of 
any non compete or similar agreement to which Employee may be subject. Employee represents and warrants that 
(i) other than for this Agreement, he is not subject to or bound by any confidentiality agreement or non disclosure or 
non compete agreement or any other agreement having a similar intent, effect or purpose, and (ii) he is free to use 
and divulge to Employer, without any obligation to or violation of any right of others, any and all information, data, 
plans, ideas, concepts, practices or techniques which he will use, describe, demonstrate, divulge, or in any other 
manner make known to Employer during the performance of services  
 
 
7  
 
7.07 Attorneys Fees. In the event that Employee has been found to have violated any of the terms of Articles 
Three or Four of this Agreement either after a preliminary injunction hearing or a trial on the merits or otherwise, 
Employee shall pay to the Employer the Employer’s costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, in enforcing the 
terms of Articles Three or Four of this Agreement.  
7.08 Advise New Employers. During Employee’ s employment with the Employer and for one (1) year 
thereafter, Employee will communicate the contents of Articles Three and Four to any individual or entity which 
Employee intends to be employed by, associated with, or represent which is engaged in a business which is 
competitive to the business of Employer.  
7.09 Captions. The captions of Articles and Sections this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and are 
not to be construed as forming a part of this Agreement.  
EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE HAS READ AND FULLY UNDERSTANDS EACH AND 
EVERY PROVISION OF THE FOREGOING AND DOES HEREBY ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THE SAME.  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.

7.02 Severability. Should any of Employee’s obligations under this Agreement or the application of the terms 
or provisions of this Agreement to any person or circumstances, to any extent, be found illegal, invalid or 
unenforceable in any respect, such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of 
this Agreement, all of which shall remain enforceable in accordance with their terms, or the application of such

Despite the preceding sentence, should any of Employee’s obligations under this Agreement be found illegal, invalid
