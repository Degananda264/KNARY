Article 27 Dispute Resolution 27.1 Referral to Senior Management Any and all controversies, disputes or differences between the Parties to this Contract, if not amicably settled by the Parties with thirty (30) days following written notice of dispute, shall be referred to senior management of the Parties for resolution.
