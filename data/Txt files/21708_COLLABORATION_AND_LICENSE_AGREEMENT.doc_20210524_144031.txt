Dicerna and Lilly are each referred to individually as a “Party” and together as the “Parties”.

BACKGROUND

A.Lilly is engaged in the research, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products for use in humans and animals.

B.    Dicerna has developed a subcutaneous RNAi platform targeting hepatocytes in the liver using GalXC Molecules (as defined below) to silence mRNA molecules in hepatocyte targets, and using that platform has demonstrated initial knock-down in murine models. Dicerna also has available tool compounds for certain targets which are expected to have application in the treatment of cardiometabolic indications.

C.    Dicerna’s platforms and know-how may also be useful in the development of other RNAi or oligonucleotide technologies with targeting mechanisms binding to or intended to bind to and induce an inhibition, disruption or modulation of mRNA in Non-Hepatocyte Targets (as defined below).

D.    Lilly and Dicerna desire to enter into this Agreement to allow Lilly to access Dicerna’s GalXC Platform for certain hepatocyte targets and engage in a collaborative research program for the joint development of New Nucleic Acid Platforms to identify multiple lead candidate targets, designated by Lilly, from which a product could be selected, in each case, on terms set forth in this Agreement.

E.    Lilly desires to obtain certain exclusive and nonexclusive licenses from Dicerna to support the activities conducted pursuant to the research program and to enable Lilly to commercialize certain products derived from or containing compounds developed pursuant to this Agreement, and Dicerna is willing to grant such rights to Lilly subject to the terms and conditions as set forth below.

F.    Concurrently with the entering into of this Agreement, Dicerna and Lilly are entering into that certain Share Issuance Agreement (the “Share Issuance Agreement”), pursuant to which Lilly is acquiring shares of Dicerna’s common stock on the terms and conditions set forth therein.

2.    TARGET RESERVATION AND SELECTION

2.1    Target Reservation.

2.1.1    Reserved Targets. Promptly after the Effective Date, but in no event later than [***] after the Effective Date, the Parties shall enter into an agreement with the initial Gatekeeper that meets the criteria under Section 2.4.1. Dicerna shall promptly thereafter provide such Gatekeeper a list of all of its Blocked Targets, which may be modified from time to time pursuant to Section 2.4.2. During the Research and Collaboration Term, Lilly may identify to the Gatekeeper up to the following number of Targets that Lilly wishes to reserve for potential selection for further Development pursuant to the Research Program (such Targets individually and collectively referred to as “Reserved Targets”), subject to Section 2.1.3:

(a)    up to [***] potential hepatocyte Targets, other than the Initially Named Targets, expected to have applications in the treatment of cardiometabolic indications (“Other Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets”);

(b)    up to [***] non-hepatocyte Targets expected to have applications in the treatment of cardiometabolic indications (“Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets”); and

(c)    such other non-hepatocyte targets [***] selected by Lilly expected to have applications in the treatment of Neurodegeneration or Pain Indications (“Non-Hepatocyte Neurodegeneration/Pain Targets” and, together with the Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets, the “Non-Hepatocyte Targets”).

Lilly shall submit its initial list of Reserved Targets within [***] after the Effective Date, and thereafter may, in its discretion, substitute another Target for any Reserved Target provided that at the time of such substitution such substituted Target is not a Blocked Target.

2.1.2    Increases to Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Reserved Targets.  Notwithstanding the numbers of Reserved Targets set forth in Section 2.1.1, Lilly shall also have the right, in its sole discretion and by written notice to Dicerna, at any time during the applicable Selection Period, to increase the number of Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets it reserves as Reserved Targets, up to a maximum of [***] Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets, provided that: (a) any increase to the number of Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets that Lilly may reserve as a Reserved Target shall simultaneously decrease the number of Other Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets that Lilly may reserve as a Reserved Target by an equal number (for example, an increase in Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets by [***], would result in a decrease in the number of Other Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets by [***]) and (b) selection of any Target would be subject to Section 2.1.3 and the Gatekeeper process described in Section 2.4.

2.1.3    Any Targets submitted by Lilly after the Effective Date to be included as a Reserved Target will be subject to confirmation of their availability by Dicerna through the Gatekeeper process described in Section 2.4.

2.2    Target Selection.

2.2.1    Selected Targets. During the applicable Selection Period, Lilly shall have the right to select from the Reserved Targets:

(a)    up to [***] Other Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets;

(b)    up to [***] Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets; and

(c)    such initial Non-Hepatocyte Neurodegeneration/Pain Targets as may be selected by Lilly, plus such additional Targets as may be recommended by Lilly and accepted by the JSC.

2.2.2    Increases to Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Selected Targets.  Notwithstanding the numbers of Selected Targets set forth in Section 2.2.1, during the applicable Selection Period, Lilly shall also have the right, in its sole discretion and by written notice to Dicerna, to increase the number of Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets it may select from the Reserved Targets, up to a maximum of [***] Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets; provided that: (a) any increase to the number of Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets that Lilly may select from the Reserved Targets shall simultaneously decrease the number of Other Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets it may select by an equal number (for example, an increase in Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets by [***] would result in a decrease in the number of Other Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets by [***]) and (b) selection of any Target that is not on the Reserved Target list at the time of such requested increase would be subject to the Gatekeeper process described in Section 2.4.

2.2.3    Non-Selected Targets. Upon the expiration of the Selection Period with respect to a particular category of Target (i.e., Other Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Target, Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Target or Non-Hepatocyte Neurodegeneration/Pain Target), the remaining Targets in that category that are not Selected Targets shall become Discontinued Targets, subject to Section 15.2, but remaining subject to Section 3.3.

2.3    Target Substitution.

2.3.1    Substitute Targets. If, at any point during the applicable Research Collaboration Term, Lilly determines, after consultation with the JSC, that it wishes to substitute a Target, whether from the Reserved Target list or otherwise, for a Selected Target, Lilly shall have the right to make such Target substitution within [***] following such determination by providing written notice to Dicerna of such substitution; provided that Lilly’s foregoing right to substitute a Target for a Selected Target shall not exceed [***] substitutions in total for cardiometabolic Selected Targets (i.e., that are Initially Named

Targets, Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets or Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets), and up to [***] substitutions in total for Non-Hepatocyte Neurodegeneration/Pain Targets.

2.3.2    Confirmation of Availability of Substitute Target. Any Target which Lilly would like to substitute for existing Targets as described in this Section 2.3 will be subject to confirmation of their availability by Dicerna through the Gatekeeper process described in Section 2.4. For avoidance of doubt, if a Target that Lilly seeks to reserve is a Blocked Target at the time Lilly seeks reservation, Lilly may designate a different Target in its place and such designation shall not be considered a substitution subject to this Section 2.3.

2.3.3    Effects of Target Substitution. If any Targets are substituted for a Selected Target in accordance with the foregoing (each, a “Substitute Target”) such Substitute Target shall be automatically deemed a Selected Target under this Agreement, and the Selected Target that such Target substituted shall be deemed a Discontinued Target and subject to the provisions of Section 15.2. In addition, the Parties shall update the Research Plan as necessary to reflect such substitution of the Substitute Target for the Discontinued Target.

2.3.4    Costs Relating to Target Substitutions. [***]

2.4    Gatekeeper Process.

2.4.1    Gatekeeper. The Parties will agree on an independent attorney nominated by Lilly and reasonably acceptable to Dicerna to act as an information gatekeeper (the “Gatekeeper”) through which Lilly may inquire as to whether any Target that Lilly intends to designate as a Selected Target (whether pursuant to Section 2.2.1 or Section 2.3.1) is a Blocked Target at that time; and through which Dicerna may inquire as to whether any Target with respect to which Dicerna intends to engage in activities that may be restricted under Section 3.1 is a Reserved Target at that time. Dicerna and Lilly will cause the Gatekeeper to enter into a customary confidentiality agreement that includes confidentiality obligations at least as stringent as the provisions set forth in Article 11 and prohibits the Gatekeeper from disclosing to Dicerna the identity of a Target that was the subject of any inquiry and the list of Reserved Targets. Nothing in this Section 2.4.1 will preclude Lilly from contacting Dicerna directly regarding the availability of Targets or otherwise, to which Dicerna will respond in its discretion or Dicerna from contacting Lilly directly regarding whether a particular Target is a Reserved Target. The initial Gatekeeper will be [***]., whom the Parties have acknowledged and agreed is independent and which law firm shall enter into an agreement regarding the continued independence of such Gatekeeper.

2.4.2    Gatekeeper Procedures. At the Effective Date Dicerna shall provide to the Gatekeeper the list of Initial Blocked Targets and from time to time thereafter (including at least once per Calendar Quarter, including in response to inquiries hereunder), (a) Dicerna will provide the Gatekeeper with a current list of all Blocked Targets, together with any applicable rights Dicerna can still grant hereunder with respect to such Blocked Targets, and any associated restrictions (such list of Blocked Targets, together with the Initial Blocked

Commission. Confidential Treatment Requested Under

17 C.F.R. Sections 200.80(b)(3) and 240.24b-2

Targets, the “Blocked Target List”), and (b) Lilly will be entitled to, at its discretion submit inquiries to the Gatekeeper. Upon receipt of an inquiry, the Gatekeeper will notify Dicerna of such inquiry by Lilly without disclosing the subject Target, after which Dicerna will have [***] to provide the Gatekeeper with any updates to the Blocked Target List. The Gatekeeper will inform Lilly in writing whether the subject Target is a Blocked Target within [***] of receipt of the associated inquiry and, if the Target is a Target as to which Dicerna can still grant rights to Lilly, the Gatekeeper will inform Lilly of the availability of such Target and what rights Dicerna can grant and any associated restrictions. If the Gatekeeper notifies Lilly in response to an inquiry (or Dicerna notifies Lilly, in the case of direct contact between the Parties) that a Target is a Blocked Target, Lilly will not have exhausted any of its rights to reserve or select Targets as a result of the inquiry, and if the status of any Blocked Target changes and it is no longer a Blocked Target, Dicerna shall promptly notify the Gatekeeper; and if such a change relates to a Target which was previously submitted by Lilly and rejected by the Gatekeeper, the Gatekeeper shall be under an obligation to notify Lilly of such change as soon as practicable. Dicerna may from time to time inquire as to whether any Target with respect to which Dicerna intends to engage in activities that may be restricted under Section 3.1 is a Reserved Target. Upon receipt of such an inquiry from Dicerna, the Gatekeeper will inform Dicerna in writing whether the subject Target is a Reserved Target within [***] of receipt of the associated inquiry.

3.    EXCLUSIVITY

3.1    Reserved Target Exclusivity – [***], with respect to each Reserved Target, Dicerna and its Affiliates shall be exclusive to and work exclusively with Lilly on each such Reserved Target. In connection with the foregoing, other than as may be incidental to research activities for Targets other than Reserved Targets, and except as may be permitted under Section 19.1 or as Dicerna may be permitted to delegate its obligations to a Third Party subcontractor pursuant to Section 4.9, Dicerna shall not (by itself nor with any Third Party) and shall cause its Affiliates not to (by themselves nor with any Third Party):

(a)    carry out Research, Development or Commercialization with respect to such Reserved Targets (or compounds, products or therapies that are Directed To such Reserved Target); or

(b)    sell, assign, transfer, convey, license, sublicense, covenant not to assert or otherwise grant or transfer, to any Third Party, any rights or immunities to or under any Licensed Technology to carry out such Research, Development or Commercialization (described in (a) above) on any Reserved Target;

in each case, until such time, if any, that the Reserved Target becomes a Discontinued Target.

In addition, during the Selection Period, with respect to each Reserved Target, Dicerna shall not enter into any agreement or take any action that would preclude its ability to extend Lilly the rights granted hereunder and otherwise perform should Lilly select such Reserved Target (which has not become a Discontinued Target) as a Selected Target.

7.4    Know-How Transfer; Availability of Employees. Within [***] following Lilly’s assumption of responsibility for Development or Commercialization of a Product under Article 4 or the Clinical-Phase Supply Agreement (and from time to time during the Term if new Know-How comes to be Controlled by Dicerna US or Dicerna Cayman), or Lilly’s termination of this Agreement under Section 14.3 followed by an election to retain license rights hereunder, Dicerna shall disclose and/or deliver to Lilly, to the extent not previously provided, copies of all data and information in Dicerna US’s or Dicerna Cayman’s possession relating to the Licensed Know-How which is reasonably necessary for Lilly’s Development or Commercialization of such Product (including for regulatory purposes). Upon Lilly’s reasonable request, Dicerna will: (a) provide reasonable technical assistance to Lilly during such disclosure or delivery set forth in the preceding sentence; and (b) make its employees and non-employee consultants reasonably available at their respective places of employment to consult with Lilly on issues arising in the course of Lilly’s Research, Development or Commercialization and in connection with any request related to a Product from any Regulatory Agency, including regulatory, scientific, technical and clinical testing issues.

7.5    Covenants. Each of Dicerna US and Dicerna Cayman covenants that it will not: (a) take any action that (i) would impose or result in a lien, charge or encumbrance of the Licensed Technology that would prevent or limit Lilly’s exercise of its license rights to such Licensed Technology, or (ii) adversely affects the license rights granted to Lilly under this Agreement; or (b) assign, transfer, convey or otherwise grant to any Person any rights to any Licensed Technology, New Platform Patents, Joint Know-How or Joint Patent Rights or any Compounds or Products, in any manner that conflicts with the exclusive licenses granted to Lilly pursuant to Section 7.1.

7.8    Third Party License Agreements.

7.8.1    If, after the Effective Date, Dicerna US or Dicerna Cayman enters into any license agreement with a Third Party and Controls Patent Rights or Know-How under such license agreement that would be necessary or reasonably useful for developing a New Platform for Non-Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets or a New Platform for Non-Hepatocyte Neurodegeneration/Pain Targets, then Dicerna shall so notify Lilly and the rights and licenses granted to Lilly under this Agreement with respect to such Third Party agreement shall be subject to Lilly (a) agreeing to be bound by the terms of any such Third Party agreement applicable to a sublicensee thereunder, and (b) reimbursing Dicerna US or Dicerna Cayman for any amounts that become owing to such Third Party by reason of the grant to, or exercise by or under the authority of, Lilly of such rights; provided, that, any amounts owing to such Third Party cannot be disproportionately allocated to the Selected Targets, Products or Lilly’s rights hereunder (e.g., the royalty for Product sales cannot be greater than the royalty due for any other product under the agreement). Upon request by Lilly, Dicerna shall disclose to Lilly a true and correct written description of the payment and other relevant obligations, and Lilly’s obligation to reimburse such amounts following such request shall be limited to those payment obligations as so disclosed by Dicerna. In the event Lilly does not agree in writing to reimburse Dicerna for such amounts upon request, and to be bound by the terms of such Third Party agreement applicable to a sublicensee thereunder, then the rights licensed under such Third Party agreement shall thereafter be deemed excluded from the Licensed Patent Rights and/or Licensed Know-How, as applicable, hereunder.

7.8.2    If, after the Effective Date, Dicerna identifies Patent Rights or Know-How covering or relating to RNAi or oligonucleotide platform technologies owned or Controlled by a Third Party that would be necessary or reasonably useful for targeting mechanisms that bind to or are intended to bind to and induce an inhibition, disruption or modulation of mRNA in Hepatocyte Cardiometabolic Targets or Non-Hepatocyte Targets, then Dicerna shall so notify Lilly and the Parties shall coordinate in good faith the negotiation of one (1) or more agreements in order to facilitate Lilly having access to such technology, which may be through an agreement directly between Lilly and such Third Party.

8.    FINANCIAL PROVISIONS

periods for such Product in such country; and (c) [***] after the First Commercial Sale of such Product in such country (the “Royalty Term”), in each case subject to Section 8.4.4.

8.4.4    Royalty Step-Downs. The Royalties under Section 8.4.1 and Section 8.4.2 shall be reduced by the following step-down provisions:

(a)    No Effective Patent Claim. Notwithstanding Section 8.4.1 and Section 8.4.2, on a country-by-country and Product-by-Product basis, if at the time of or after the First Commercial Sale of a particular Product in a country or anytime thereafter, such Product is not Covered by one or more Effective Patent Claims in such country, then the Royalty rate at which Lilly is required to pay during the Royalty Term to Dicerna US on the Net Sales of such Product in such country shall be reduced to [***] of the Royalty rate set forth in Section 8.4.1 or Section 8.4.2, as applicable for the rest of the Royalty Term.

(b)    Third Party Royalties – Anti-Stacking. If Lilly determines that Lilly and/or its Affiliates or sublicensees need to obtain a license from a Third Party (including an Acquirer) in order to Research, Develop or Commercialize a Product in a particular country, Lilly shall have the right to deduct [***] percent [***] of all upfront, milestone, royalty or other payments due from Lilly and/or its Affiliates or sublicensees under such license with the Third Party from the Royalty owing to Dicerna US during the applicable period for the such Product under Section 8.4.1 and Section 8.4.2, as applicable, subject to the Royalty reduction floor as set forth in Section 8.4.4(e); provided, that any credit not applied because of such Royalty reduction floor may be carried forward to future Calendar Quarters.

(c)    Competing Products – Initial Reduction. On a country-by-country and Product-by-Product basis, Lilly’s obligation to pay Royalties to Dicerna US for a particular Product in a country shall be reduced to [***] percent [***] of the Royalty rate set forth in Section 8.4.1 and Section 8.4.2, as applicable, upon the first sale of Competing Product(s) of such Product by a Third Party or Third Parties in such country. A “Competing Product” of a Product means a product whose sale is not authorized by Lilly or its Affiliates or sublicensees, that is [***].

(d)    Competing Products – Royalty Elimination. On a country-by-country and Product-by-Product basis, Lilly’s obligation to pay Royalties to Dicerna US for a particular Product in a country under Section 8.4.1 or Section 8.4.2, as applicable, shall expire and be of no further effect from and after the first Calendar Quarter in which a Competing Product to the Product has a market share of [***] percent [***] or more in a given country (measured in local currency, over the Calendar Quarter, as reported by [***], at which point the Royalty Term for that Product shall also be considered terminated in that country.

(e)    Limit on Royalty Reductions. In no event shall the Royalties owed under Sections 8.4.1 or Section 8.4.2, as applicable, with respect to a Product in a country be reduced by operation of Sections 8.4.4(a), 8.4.4(b) or 8.4.4(c) by

more than an aggregate of [***] percent [***] of what would otherwise be owed under the tables set forth in Sections 8.4.1 or Section 8.4.2, as applicable with respect to such Product in such country, it being understood that this restriction will not apply to Section 8.4.4(d).

9.    REPORTS AND PAYMENT TERMS

9.1    Net Sales Reports and Royalties Due. During the Royalty Term, Lilly shall furnish to Dicerna US a written report for each Calendar Quarter showing the global Net Sales by Product sold by Lilly, its Affiliate or sublicensee during the reporting Calendar Quarter, the Royalties payable under this Agreement and whether a Commercial Milestone Event has been achieved in sufficient detail to allow Dicerna US to verify the amount of Royalties or Commercial Milestone Payments paid by Lilly with respect to such Calendar Quarter, including on a Product-by-Product basis, the Net Sales of each Product, and the Royalties (in USD) payable and in total for all Products. Reports shall be due no later than [***] following the end of each Calendar Quarter.

9.4    Taxes. Each Party shall be responsible for its own tax liabilities arising under this Agreement. Subject to this Section 9.4, Dicerna US shall be liable for all income and other taxes (including interest) (“Taxes”) imposed upon any payments made by Lilly to Dicerna US under this Agreement (“Agreement Payments”). If Applicable Laws require the withholding of Taxes by either Party or its Affiliates, such Taxes shall be retained by the Party making such payment (the “Payor”) as required by such Applicable Law from such remittable royalty or other payment and shall be timely remitted by the Payor to the proper tax authorities on behalf of the Party with respect to which such deduction and withholding was made (the “Payee”); provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Lilly’s assignment of this Agreement to an entity outside the United States leads to the imposition of withholding Tax liability on Dicerna US that would not have been imposed in the absence of such action or in an increase in such liability above the liability that would have been imposed in the absence of such action, Lilly will indemnify and hold harmless Dicerna US from any such additional or increased withholding Tax liability (except to the extent that Dicerna US or any of its Affiliates can reclaim it, provided that Dicerna US will be reimbursed for any reasonable out of pocket costs incurred in the reclaim). The Payor shall promptly (as available) submit to the Payee appropriate proof of payment of the withheld Taxes as well as the official receipts sufficient to enable the Payee to claim such payments of Taxes.  To the extent that a Party is required to deduct and withhold Taxes on any such payment pursuant to this Section 9.4, such Party will provide the Payee with written notice of the required withholding

as promptly as reasonably practical (and in any event, no later than fifteen (15) Business Days) prior to making such payment, and the Parties shall cooperate and exercise their reasonable best efforts to ensure that any such withholding Taxes are reduced as far as possible under the provisions of any Applicable Law, and shall provide Payee reasonable assistance in order to allow Payee to obtain the benefit of any present or future treaty against double taxation or refund or reduction in Taxes which may apply to the Agreement Payments.

9.5    Audit Rights (Financial).

9.5.1    Each Party (the “Auditing Party”) shall have the right to appoint at its expense an independent certified public accountant of nationally recognized standing (the “Accounting Firm”) reasonably acceptable to the other Party to inspect or audit the relevant records of the other Party (the “Audited Party”) in order to verify that the amount of such expenses and payments (“Expenses and Payments”) were correctly determined. Prior to commencing the implementation of such audit the Auditing Party shall submit an audit plan, including audit scope, to the other Audited Party for approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Audited Party shall each make its records available for inspection or audit by the Accounting Firm during regular business hours at such place or places where such records are customarily kept, upon reasonable notice from the Auditing Party, solely to verify the expenses and payments hereunder were correctly determined. Such inspection or audit right shall not be exercised by the Auditing Party more than once in any Calendar Year and may cover a period [***] All records made available for inspection or audit shall be deemed to be Confidential Information of the Audited Party. The results of each inspection or audit, if any, shall be binding on both Parties. The Auditing Party shall bear the full cost of such audit unless such audit discloses at least a [***] shortfall [***], in which case the Audited Party will bear all reasonable costs and expenses of the audit. The Auditing Party will be entitled to recover any shortfall in payments as determined by such audit. Similarly, if the audit reveals an overpayment, the Auditing Party will be entitled to recover such overpayment as determined by such audit as actually received by the Audited Party. Any underpayment or overpayment as determined under this Section 9.5.1 shall be promptly (but in any event no later than [***] after the Auditing Party’s receipt of the Accounting Firm’s report so concluding) paid to the Party entitled to payment hereunder.

right, title and interest in and to any such Improvements within the Lilly Background IP that are discovered, conceived or otherwise generated by Dicerna in connection with the Research Program or otherwise.

10.3    Dicerna Background IP.

Lilly hereby assigns and agrees to assign to Dicerna all right, title and interest in and to any such Improvements within the Dicerna Background IP that are discovered, conceived or otherwise generated by Lilly in connection with the Research Program or otherwise. If the Parties determine by mutual agreement that any Lilly Know-How shall necessarily be contributed to the development of the GalXC Platform, the Parties shall develop a mutually acceptable strategy for prosecution of any Patent Rights directed to such Lilly Know-How through a joint patent process via a Working Group pursuant to Section 6.3, prior to contributing such Lilly Know-How to the GalXC Platform.

10.6    Filing, Prosecution, Enforcement and Defense.

10.6.1    GalXC Patents and Dicerna Background IP. As between the Parties, Dicerna shall, at its sole cost, be responsible for the filing, prosecution, enforcement and defense of any Licensed Patent Rights directed to the GalXC Platform (“GalXC Patents”) and Dicerna Background IP, other than any Product-Specific Patents; provided, that Lilly shall have the first right, but not the obligation, at its sole cost, to enforce the GalXC Patents to the extent such enforcement action is solely directed against an RNAi product Directed To a Selected Target being Researched, Developed, used, made (including formulated) or Commercialized by a Third Party (“Competing RNAi Product”).

10.6.2    New Platform Patents and Other Joint Patent Rights. The Parties will share, in equal amount, the out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of the Licensed Patent Rights directed to

Commission. Confidential Treatment Requested Under

17 C.F.R. Sections 200.80(b)(3) and 240.24b-2

a New Nucleic Acid Platform (“New Platform Patents”) and other Joint Patent Rights (other than Product-Specific Patents) through a joint patent process via a Working Group pursuant to Section 6.3, and using a mutually agreed counsel (which may be in-house counsel), and shall equally share the costs of such filing and prosecution activities, unless a Party opts to abandon its interest in a Joint Patent Right by notice to the other Party, in which case Section 10.6.4 shall apply. Each Party shall reimburse the other for its share of such expenses following receipt of an invoice from the Party incurring such expenses (including reasonable documentation of such expenses if requested). Each Party shall keep the other reasonably informed of, and consult with the other Party with respect to the status and prosecution of all patent applications and patents included in such Joint Patent Rights, including providing in a timely manner the other Party with copies of all material correspondence with the applicable patent regulatory authority and the opportunity to review and comment on any papers, responses or other filings prepared for submissions to said authorities in advance of their filing. Each Party at its own discretion shall have the opportunity to separately enforce and defend the New Platform Patents and other Joint Patent Rights following good faith consultation with the other Party, keeping the other Party regularly informed throughout the proceeding and considering in good faith such other Party’s comments (other than Product-Specific Patents, which shall be subject to Section 10.6.3) except that: (i) Lilly shall have the first right but not the obligation to enforce the New Platform Patents and Joint Patent Rights (other than Product-Specific Patents), at Lilly’s cost, to the extent such action is solely directed against a Competing RNAi Product; and (ii) Dicerna shall have the first right but not the obligation to enforce the New Platform Patents and Joint Patent Rights (other than Product-Specific Patents), at Dicerna’s cost, to the extent such enforcement action is solely directed to a product competitive to a product being Researched, Developed or Commercialized by Dicerna or its licensees.

10.6.3    Product-Specific Patents. Lilly shall be responsible for the prosecution, maintenance, defense, and enforcement of all Joint Patent Rights and Licensed Patent Rights directed to the Product or Selected Target (“Product-Specific Patents”), at Lilly’s cost.

10.6.4    Abandonment of Patent Rights. If Dicerna or Lilly elects to cease the filing, prosecution, maintenance and/or defense of a Patent Right for which Dicerna or Lilly, as applicable, is in control of the filing, prosecution, maintenance and/or defense pursuant to Section 10.6.2 or 10.6.3 in any country of the Territory, Dicerna or Lilly, as applicable, shall provide the other Party with notice promptly following its decision to abandon the filing, prosecution, maintenance and/or defense of such Patent Right, but in no event later than sixty (60) days before the next relevant deadline relating to or any public disclosure of the relevant Patent Right. In such event, the abandoning Party shall permit the other Party, at such other Party’s sole discretion, to take over or continue, as the case may be, the filing, prosecution, maintenance and defense of such abandoned Patent Right on behalf of and in the name of the abandoning Party, but at the other Party’s own expense. If such other Party elects to take over and continue such filing, prosecution, maintenance or defense, the abandoning Party shall execute such documents and perform such acts, at the other Party’s expense, as may be reasonably necessary to permit such other Party to take

Commission. Confidential Treatment Requested Under

17 C.F.R. Sections 200.80(b)(3) and 240.24b-2

over and continue the filing, prosecution, maintenance and/or defense of such abandoned Patent Right on behalf and in the name of the abandoning Party and at the other Party’s own expense. For the avoidance of doubt, the abandoning Party shall remain the owner of the abandoned Patent Right(s) but shall have no further say in the filing, prosecution, maintenance and defense of such abandoned Patent Right(s); provided, however, that the non-abandoning Party shall timely inform the abandoning Party if it too decides to finally abandon the respective Patent Right, in which event the other Party shall have the right to re-assume sole responsibility for ongoing prosecution, maintenance and defense of such abandoned Patent Right in accordance with this Section 10.6.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if Lilly determines, in its reasonable discretion following good faith discussions with Dicerna, that any such abandonment is necessary to avoid detrimental effect to any Product-Specific Patent, then Dicerna shall have no right pursuant to this Section 10.6.4 to elect to take over and continue the filing, prosecution, maintenance or defense of such Product-Specific Patent.

10.6.5    Notification of Infringement. Lilly and Dicerna shall each promptly notify the other in writing of any alleged or threatened infringement of the Licensed Patent Rights or Joint Patent Rights of which they become aware (each, an “Action”), and the prosecution and enforcement of such alleged or threatened infringement of the Joint Patent Rights shall be done in accordance with this Section 10.6.

10.6.6    Control of Enforcement Actions.  The Party specified in this Section 10.6 as having control over enforcement of particular Patent Rights alleged or threatened to be infringed in an Action (the “Initial Party”) may, at its expense, commence litigation with respect to the alleged or threatened infringement at its own expense or otherwise seek to handle such Action. If the Initial Party elects, in its sole discretion, to handle such an Action, the Initial Party shall control such Action, and the Initial Party may enter into settlements, stipulated judgments or other arrangements respecting such infringement; provided, however, the Initial Party shall not take any action, including legal action, settle or make any agreement that adversely affects the other Party’s rights or interests, including any settlement or agreement which admits or concedes that any aspect of any of the Lilly Intellectual Property or Licensed Technology is invalid or unenforceable or which adversely affects the scope of any of the Lilly Intellectual Property (in case where Dicerna is the Initial Party) or Licensed Technology (in case where Lilly is the Initial Party), without the prior written consent of the other Party. The Initial Party shall keep the other Party reasonably apprised of the progress of any such Action. The other Party may, at its option and sole expense, be represented by counsel of its choice, but all other costs associated with any such Action shall be at the sole expense of the Initial Party. In the event that the Initial Party does not commence litigation or otherwise address an Action within thirty (30) Business Days following the date on which Lilly or Dicerna (as applicable) notifies the other Party of any alleged or threatened infringement of the Licensed Patent Rights, New Platform Patents or Joint Patent Rights of which they become aware pursuant to Section 10.6.5, the other Party may do so, at the other Party’s expense; provided, however, that in the event the initial Party in good faith objects to the other Party pursuing such Action on the grounds that pursuit of such Action is not in the long term best interest of the Products, the GalXC

14.3.1    If a Party materially breaches this Agreement, the non-breaching Party may provide the breaching Party with a written notice specifying the nature of the breach, and stating its intention to terminate this Agreement if such breach is not cured. If the material breach is not cured by the allegedly breaching Party within [***] days (or ninety [***] days in the event of an undisputed payment default) after the receipt of such notice or if such other breach is curable but cannot be cured within the [***] day period (which inability shall not apply to undisputed payment defaults) and the allegedly breaching Party fails to use diligent efforts to promptly cure such breach, or the allegedly breaching Party fails to dispute the alleged breach, within such [***] day period, then in each case the non-breaching Party shall be entitled, without prejudice to any of its other rights under this Agreement, and in addition to any other remedies available to it by law or in equity, to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the other Party. If the allegedly breaching Party in good faith disputes such material breach or the failure to cure or remedy such material breach such Party shall, within [***] days of receipt of written notice from the other Party of its intention to terminate (x) provide written notice of that dispute putting forward in reasonable detail the rationale for disputing the alleged breach to the notifying Party and (y) initiate expedited arbitration procedures in accordance with Section 19.6, in which case, such termination shall not be effective until [***] days after the arbitration award determining that the conditions for termination of this Section 14.3 are met; provided further that the breach is not cured within such [***] day period.

If permitted under such a surviving sublicense, effective upon termination of this Agreement, such sublicense shall become a direct license from Dicerna US and Dicerna Cayman to such sublicensee; provided, that, if assignment of the sublicense or such conversion of the sublicense to a direct license is not permitted under the applicable sublicense, Lilly shall be entitled to retain its right to payment

All applicable terms and provisions of this Agreement, except this right to extend, shall apply to any such Affiliate to which this Agreement has been extended to the same extent as such terms and provisions apply to the Party extending such rights and immunities. For clarity, Lilly extending the rights and immunities granted hereunder shall remain primarily liable for any acts or omissions of its Affiliates.

19.4    Severability. Should one or more of the provisions of this Agreement become void or unenforceable, or be determined to be void or unenforceable, as a matter of Applicable Laws, then this Agreement shall be construed as if such provision were not contained herein and the remainder of this Agreement shall be in full force and effect, and the Parties will use their best efforts to substitute for the invalid or unenforceable provision a valid and enforceable provision which conforms as nearly as possible with the original intent of the Parties.

19.5    Governing Law; English Language. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the patent laws of the United States without giving effect to any law that would result in the application of a different body of law than as set forth in this Section 19.5.

19.6    Dispute Resolution.

19.6.1    If any dispute, claim or controversy of any nature arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including any action or claim based on tort, contract or statute, or concerning the interpretation, effect, termination, validity, performance or breach of this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”), arises between the Parties and the Parties cannot resolve such Dispute through their respective Project Leaders or JSC, if and as applicable, within [***] days of a written request by either Party to the other Party (“Notice of Dispute”), and such Dispute is not one for which a Party has final decision-making as expressly set forth in Section 6.4.4 of this Agreement, either Party may refer the Dispute to senior representatives of each Party for resolution.

If, after an additional [***] days after the Notice of Dispute, such representatives have not succeeded in negotiating a resolution of the Dispute, and a Party wishes to pursue the matter, each such Dispute, controversy or claim that is not an “Excluded Claim” (defined in Section 19.6.5) shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the Expedited Procedures under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) pursuant to its rules in effect at the time such dispute arises, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The obligation to arbitrate under this Section 19.6 shall extend to any claims by or against the Parties and their respective Affiliates and any agents, principals, officers, directors, or employees of either of the Parties or their respective Affiliates.

19.6.2    The arbitration shall be conducted by [***] experienced in the business of pharmaceuticals. If the issues in dispute involve scientific, technical or commercial matters, the arbitrators chosen hereunder shall engage experts that have educational training or industry experience sufficient to demonstrate a reasonable level of relevant scientific, medical and industry knowledge, as necessary to resolve the dispute. Within [***] days after initiation of arbitration, the Parties shall select the arbitrator. If the Parties are unable or fail to agree upon the arbitrators within such [***] day period, the arbitrators shall be appointed by ICC. The place of arbitration shall be [***], and all proceedings and communications shall be in English.

19.6.3    Prior to the arbitrators being selected, either Party, without waiving any remedy under this Agreement, may seek from any court having jurisdiction any temporary injunctive or provisional relief necessary to protect the rights or property of that Party until final resolution of the issue by the arbitrators or other resolution of the controversy between the Parties. Once the arbitrators are in place, either Party may apply to the arbitrators for interim injunctive relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved, and either Party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce interim injunctive relief granted by the arbitrators. Any final award by the arbitrators may be entered by either Party in any court having appropriate jurisdiction for a judicial recognition of the decision and applicable orders of enforcement. The arbitrators may render early or summary disposition of some or all issues, after the Parties have had a reasonable opportunity to make submissions on those issues. The arbitrators shall have no authority to award punitive or any other type of damages not measured by a Party’s compensatory damages. Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses and attorneys’ fees and an equal share of the arbitrators’ fees and any administrative fees of arbitration, unless the arbitrators agree otherwise.

19.6.4    Except to the extent necessary to confirm an award or as may be required by law, neither a Party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of an arbitration without the prior written consent of both Parties. In no event shall an arbitration be initiated after the date when commencement of a legal or equitable proceeding based on the dispute, controversy or claim would be barred by the applicable New York statute of limitations.

19.7    Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be responsible to the other for any failure or delay in performing any of its obligations under this Agreement or for other nonperformance hereunder (excluding, in each case, the obligation to make payments when due) if such delay or nonperformance is caused by strike, fire, flood, earthquake, accident, war, act of terrorism, act of God or of the government of any country or of any local government, or by any other cause unavoidable or beyond the control of any Party hereto. In such event, such affected Party shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to resume performance of its obligations and will keep the other Party informed of actions related thereto.

19.8    Waivers and Amendments.

RNA interference (RNAi) is an emerging new approach to drug discovery, focused on a biologic process in which certain RNA molecules inhibit the expression of disease-causing genes by destroying the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of those genes. RNAi has the potential to treat diseases by silencing some of the most well-validated, yet previously inaccessible drug targets.

“At Lilly, we go to where breaking science meets unmet medical needs,” said Daniel M. Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly senior vice president and chief scientific officer. “We are excited to collaborate with Dicerna and utilize their RNAi expertise to study targets that up until now have proven to be very technically challenging. RNAi has the potential to treat an array of diseases that are of strategic importance to Lilly. Together with Dicerna, we aim to employ this emerging modality for greater success in drug development.”

“The collaboration with Lilly provides an exceptional opportunity to leverage our proprietary GalXC platform in order to generate new medicines for cardio-metabolic diseases, and to establish a presence in new fields including neurodegeneration and pain,” said Douglas M. Fambrough, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Dicerna. “Lilly, with its demonstrated leadership in each of these fields, is an ideal partner for extending the range of Dicerna’s proprietary GalXC technology, which is designed to silence the expression of disease-driving genes. We are eager and ready to expand and advance our pipeline of innovative GalXC-based therapies, including both proprietary and partnered programs.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Dicerna will receive an upfront payment of $100 million, as well as an equity investment of $100 million at a premium. Dicerna is also eligible to receive up to approximately $350 million per target in development and commercialization milestones, as well as tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single to low-double digits on product sales. Dicerna will work exclusively with Lilly in the neurodegeneration and pain fields, and on select targets in cardio-metabolic diseases. The two companies anticipate collaborating on more than ten targets.

About RNAi

RNA interference (RNAi) is a biologic process in which certain double-stranded RNA molecules inhibit the expression of disease-causing genes by destroying the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of those genes. It reflects a new approach in the development of specific and powerful therapies. Rather than targeting and binding to proteins to inhibit their activity, RNAi exerts its effects one step earlier in the gene silencing process by targeting the mRNA, the instruction set that directs the building of the protein. By attaching to this instruction set, RNAi is believed to have the ability to attack any target, including disease-causing genes that are beyond the reach of conventional antibody and small-molecule modalities. Additionally, RNAi-based therapeutic approaches hold the potential to offer more convenience for patients via infrequent dosing and a long duration of effect.

About Dicerna’s GalXC™ RNAi Technology Platform

The proprietary RNAi technology platform called GalXC™, invented by Dicerna, aims to advance the development of next-generation RNAi-based therapies designed to silence disease-driving genes in the liver. GalXC-based therapies are processed by the Dicer enzyme, which is the natural initiation point for RNAi within the human cell. Using GalXC, Dicerna scientists attach N-acetylgalactosamine sugars directly to the extended region of the proprietary Dicer substrate short-interfering RNA (DsiRNA) molecules, yielding multiple conjugate delivery configurations that allow flexible and efficient conjugation to the targeting ligands while stabilizing the RNAi duplex. Dicerna believes this stabilization will enable subcutaneous delivery of RNAi therapies to hepatocytes in the liver, where they are designed to specifically bind to receptors on target cells, potentially leading to internalization and access to the RNAi machinery within the cells. By using the Dicer enzyme as the entry point into RNAi, the GalXC

approach seeks to optimize the activity of the RNAi pathway so that it operates in the most specific and potent fashion. Compounds produced via GalXC are intended to be broadly applicable across multiple therapeutic areas, including rare diseases, viral infectious diseases, chronic liver diseases and cardiovascular diseases.
